Suddenly I have time to watch entire games of baseball, which I haven't been able to do much since the early 2000's. I even watched an entire 6 part series about the Mariners on SB Nation. It was fascinating and reminded me of how much I love this weird ass sport don't judge me.

Anyway, I think it would be cool to follow a Japanese team this year. Do any of you have any experience doing that from the US? Is there an affordable streaming service where you can watch the games on demand? Are there certain teams you think I should follow? I know I'm already a Hokkaido-Nippon Ham Fighters fan. I don't know anything about the Ham Fighters other than the fact that their name is the Ham Fighters but that's enough to win my fandom.

What's more is that if your cutout is hit by a home run, you receive the following:

* The authenticated and autographed home run ball
* Two (2) Green Monster Tickets for a 2021 Red Sox home game, subject to availability and any applicable health and safety restrictions
* A custom Boston Red Sox replica home jersey with your last name on it
* Video replay of the home run

While we can't cheer our boys at home, let's at least make sure they know we're looking out for them when they face our biggest rivals by having an r/nyyankees cutout atop the Green Monster.  

So, if you're interested in donating, PM me with how much you're willing to donate.  I'll keep this thread updated daily with the amounts as we get closer to our goal.  Once we reach $500, I'll reach out to everyone who committed to submit payment via a Venmo account.  **The person who donates the most will get to choose the cutout.**  It can be of yourself, a loved one, Meredith, Bucky Dent, etc.  The Red Sox *do* ""reserve the right to reject any cutouts that are not in good taste"" so do keep in mind there's a chance they might reject it if it's distasteful.  

The cutoff to have the cutout for the first month of games already passed, but we will be able to submit for the second half from August 28, 2020 to September 24, 2020.

I decided to compare his and Jeter's stat lines:

* Jeter: .409/.480/.864, 9 for 22, with 3 BB, 8 K, 2 HR, 2 RBI, 6 R
* O'Neill: .474/.545/.789, 9 for 19, with 3 BB, 4 K, 0 HR, 2 RBI 2 R

Also, worth noting that one of O'Neill's three walks was an epic 10-pitch, 9th inning at bat against Armando Benitez which completely saved the game and kept the Yankees alive. Quite possibly the most important base on balls in Yankees history.

Three batters later, the Sox escape the half inning and now go into the top of the ninth needing only one run. Suddenly, the lights go black in the stadium. Gasps echo through the crowd as fans are unsure of what is happening. Is there technical issues? Will we be heading home? Seemingly out of nowhere, The Undertaker theme music begins to play over the loud stadium speakers. With the cover of darkness, a platform positioned under the pitchers mound rises up to field level. Now, the lights in the stadium slowly come back on. Through the dim light, a large shadow appears on the mound. As the lights increase, large pools of sweat can be seen around the pitchers mound. Bah Gawd, could it be? It is! Aroldis Chapman has risen onto the field to wreak havoc upon Boston hitters. After firing 9 straight Cuban Missiles, Aroldis smacks his glove and put his hands in the air. He has done it again. There is pandemonium in the stadium as every fan located behind home plate has soiled themselves over the thought of a misplaced Cuban Missile smacking them in the dome.

*A few years passed and the Yankees and Cashman discovered the new hero, a league ace named Cole*

*And although his pitching skills are great, he has a season to play before he can restore honor. But I believe Cole can save the World Series...*

1594851105,Why does this sub hate Jorge Posada?,"I honestly don‚Äôt get it. Posada is a Yankees legend and actual fans love him, but people on here love to drag his name through the mud. 

Posada had an illustrious 17-year career with New York, 1995-2011. He was an the All-Star five times, won the Silver Slugger Award five times, and played on five World Series champions. During the catcher‚Äôs career, he batted .273, hit 275 home runs, and drove in 1,065 runs.

In 2003 Posada finished third in voting for the American League Most Valuable Player Award after hitting 30 home runs, batting .281, and posting 101 RBIs. Aside from Yogi Berra, he was only the second Yankee catcher to hit 30 home runs in a season. Posada‚Äôs best season was 2007, when he hit .338 and batted in 90 runs at the age of 35.

The switch-hitter was only the fifth major-league catcher with at least 1,500 hits, 350 doubles, 275 homers, and 1,000 RBIs. He produced more RBIs and home runs than any other catcher in baseball from 2000 to 2011.

In 2007 the Yankees catcher won his fifth and final Silver Slugger Award as he posted career highs in batting average (.338), hits (171), and doubles (42). Posada also clubbed 20 homers and knocked in 90 runs. He had caught at least 120 games each season from 2000 through 2007. He finished sixth in the MVP voting. He was nominated again for the Roberto Clemente Award, and was named one of the finalists. He also received the Bart Giamatti ‚ÄúCaring‚Äù Award from MLB‚Äôs Baseball Assistance Team. 

All in all, Posada is a legend and a good guy. This sub hates him because he didn‚Äôt get along with Girardi. It‚Äôs a shame how much hate this sub has.",self.NYYankees,hrxbmp,11,False,NYYankees

1594762345,Does Reggie Jackson deserve to have his number retired?,"According to some people on here, Reggie Jackson doesn‚Äôt deserve to have his number retired and he‚Äôs an ‚Äúa-hole‚Äù. I think this is ridiculous. Even though he only played 5 seasons with the Yankees he was a 5x All- Star, 2x World Series, 1977 World Series MVP, and was one of the most iconic players ever. He became ‚ÄúMr.October‚Äù with the Yankees and they even had candy bars named after him. 

Even though he originally didn‚Äôt get along with some of his teammate, he ended becoming good friends with them especially Munson. 

After Jackson retired, Jackson and Steinbrenner reconciled, and Steinbrenner hired Jackson as a ""special assistant to the principal owner"", making him a consultant and a liaison to the team's players, particularly those of minority standing. By this point, the Yankees, long noted for being slow to adapt to changes in race relations, had come to develop many minority players in their farm system and seek out others via trades and free agency. 

Reggie Jackson is a legend and people on here need to stop the hate.

just a quick thought that i will put out there. i wonder how badly baseball is going to mangle respecting blm once this all starts. i'll be honest that soccer has handled this really well. they've embraced letting players express themselves on this, everyone is doing the take a knee for a moment before the kickoff of every game, even refs and stuff. the leagues are letting it happen and supporting it. it's simple, it works, it makes a positive statement, and it lets the athletes make their feelings known without causing much of a ruckus. given that ours is the next sport to hopefully resume, you have to think they're going to have to do something, but i really expect manfred and the owners to bungle this up completely. just a thought i'm putting out there.

1594571127,A very short rant about masks (or lack thereof) at camp as Chapman tests positive for Covid.,"I was reading the [article about Clint](https://www.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/hpk4dp/new_york_yankees_clint_frazier_makes_positive/) wearing a mask at camp earlier and, to be honest, I'm disappointed this is so news-worthy considering the state of the country. 

Honestly, I'm very disappointed by this team's lack of response/example in wearing a mask in general. 

This is a nation-wide issue with clear-cut right/wrong sides and a total lack of leadership, and the only Yankee leading by example, or wearing a mask on the field at all, has been our 6th outfielder who is unlikely to make the team if everyone is healthy (BIG IF BTW).

I haven't seen the leaders of the team: Judge, Gardy, Gleyber, Stanton, wear a mask once. NOT EVEN ONCE. Not even at yesterday's camp, a single day after the 2nd best pitcher on the team tests positive **after** negative intake testing. 

I appreciate most of the guys saying they're committed to doing the right things during the season, but how about being an example for the millions of confused Americans that look to athletes for lifestyle guidance? 

I know it's reflex for these guys, but I've seen Gary spit in the dugout, Judge and Cole giving high 5's, etc etc. It's unacceptable.

No one has signed off of an interview saying, ""wear a mask people"". Nothing. No stance on it whatsoever. 

It really makes me think players/celebrities live in their own bubble. Like I said, I'm disappointed no one on this team is leading by example.",self.NYYankees,hpx56d,21,False,NYYankees

Once everything shut down I called them and they said that we had to wait until the original event day to do anything about the tickets. So on June 12 I called them to ask for a refund. Additionally to this game I had purchase a May Ballpark pass directly form the Yankees and that was refunded pretty easily in the middle of June. So I was expecting something similar with StubHub. But no, they say the event can still happen and because of that they will not refund me. Additionally they changed their internal policies to not give any refunds under any circumstances after a bunch of cancelled events do to COVID-19. So I went ahead and submitted a dispute with my credit card company. I did the mistake of not providing any support, so StubHub responded to the CC company saying that I was not due a refund because the event is not canceled, and even if it was cancelled, they claim that I am not due a refund.

This week because the StubHub response the cc company sided with them, but I called the CC company and reopen the dispute and provided support including a print out of the new published schedule and a page print out from the Yankees that says that refunds are available for those who request it. I also called StubHub to see if they would be reasonable, but now they say they have closed out my StubHub account because I submitted a claim with my CC company and they will not willingly give me any refund.

1594143132,ISO - Family treasure signed Yankees baseball that was stolen,"I am searching for a treasured, signed Yankees baseball that was stolen from me during a college move. I've been looking for it since spring of 2016 on eBay and other secondhand sites, and it just occurred to me that maybe fans have seen it being posted for sale at some point. 

This ball commemorated my first baseball game with my dad. I was 7 or 8, and we visited the old Yankees Stadium for a Yankees-Mets Subway series. My dad caught a practice ball that a Mets player passed out before the game, and afterwards, we waited outside by the athlete buses for the players. I was so young, but my dad pushed me to the front of the crowd with a pen, and I was so overwhelmed by the people, the lights, and the noise that I thrust out the ball to anyone that would sign it. Derek Jeter signed the ball, one of the managers signed it, and the funny quirk about this ball is that I accidentally got it signed twice by Jorge Posada. Neither of us noticed the other grab/offer it twice! 

My dad kept the ball safe for so many years, but when I moved for school, he entrusted me with the ball we both treasured so much. He technically isn't my dad but actually my step-dad, and this bonding moment was the first time that he shared his love for a hobby with me. He let me take it so that I could feel at home at school, but during a particular stressful move senior year moving out of New York City, it never made it home with me. 

While no one can take away the precious memory that I shared with my dad, I still carry a hope that I can recover that ball. I am willing to pay whatever it takes to find it, so if anyone has ever seen this quirky ball or heard about it anywhere, please let me know. I appreciate any help, even if it might be long gone.",self.NYYankees,hmz0zt,7,False,NYYankees

1593913827,You wake up in Brian Cashman‚Äôs body the day after the 2001 WS. What decisions do you make over the years to avoid the postseason failures of the 2002-2012 Yankees?,"A few rules for this game. You can only change one decision per year and it has to be a realistic decision. In other words you can‚Äôt trade a random player for a future star that hasn‚Äôt broken out yet.

2001/2002 offseason: Re-sign Tino Martinez instead of signing Giambi. I believe signing Giambi was the beginning of the Yankees downfall as it began the era of irresponsible free agent decisions.

2002/2003 offseason: Sign David Ortiz. Rumor is that Brian Cashman wanted to sign Ortiz as he believed Ortiz was due for a breakout, but was overruled by George. Ortiz in a Yankees uniform is vomit inducing, but the blow is comforted by the fact that without Ortiz, the Red Sox likely don‚Äôt win the 3 titles they did from 2004-2013. 

2003/2004 offseason: Sign Vlad Guerrero instead of Gary Sheffield. Vlad wanted to be a Yankee, but the Yankees chose the shorter term of Sheffield over the longer term Vlad. 

2004/2005 offseason: Sign Carlos Beltran. Like Vlad, Beltran desperately wanted to be a Yankee, but the Yankees never made a serous run at him. 

2007/2008 offseason: Not re-sign A-Rod/Trade for Miguel Cabrera. I‚Äôm breaking one of my rules here, but I feel that trading for Miggy implies A-Rod wasn‚Äôt re-signed. The Marlins wanted two of Joba, Phil Hughes or Ian Kennedy, but the Yankees declined to part with them. 

I obviously skipped a few years as nothing came to mind for those years, but I‚Äôm curious as to what you guys think.",self.NYYankees,hler7n,36,False,NYYankees

Notes:

* Honorable mention for 1996 goes to the [Jeffrey Maier homerun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNlvnsQ828&amp;t=188s)
* 1999 was a tossup for me between the Curtis homer and the [Bernie walk-off in Game 1 of the ALCS vs. the Sox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDbXrNIzhGI)
* 2001 was especially tough as the Tino and Brosius homers were epic. I recommend watching the short Yankees doc [I Was There When: 2001 World Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcvuexucmVU&amp;t=705s) if you want to reminisce and get the whole feeling of Games 4 and 5 (you can skip to 8:06 to watch those moments)
* I was tempted to put this [Bonds moonshot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQeJ8YQuqh8) for 2002 even though it doesn't really fit the criteria
* 2004-2008 wasn't easy.  Some highlights I left out - [A-Rod's 3 HR, 10 RBI game (2005)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H9PtxR9WB4), [Cano's first career HR into the upper deck (2005)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgnVxi6eWVQ), [A-Rod's walk-off grand slam (2007)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejh8p_zq3Og), [Josh Hamilton's 1st round at the HR Derby (2008)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IGoFTUVTbw)
* 2009 had a lot of great moments. Watching the video of the [17 Yankee walk-offs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TptEUl_dHDo) is worth it. The WS clinching Matsui performance, starting with his [2nd inning homer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD-roXvAC9g), is also up there
* The [Longoria walk-off homer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZItPjUqdiY) in 2011 to eliminate the Sox was weirdly epic for the Yanks
* I really had to scrape for 2010, 2013, and 2014, so I would be happy to hear any replacement suggestions
* [A-Rod's 3000th hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RohR1Sjj4l8) is a candidate for 2015
* Maybe [Gary's 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voS5EPObU4M) deserves the spot, but Judge's intro to NY is pretty good too
* 2017 has a lot of moments. I love the [Greg Bird home run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sMfKenxlJo) off Andrew Miller in a must-win Game 3 of the ALDS to lead the Yanks to a 1-0 win. Also the [Didi Game 5 homers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xredFy2nqT4). And here's a cut of [all 52 of Judge's homers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw3pFHMM9fk&amp;t=154s) (skip to 2:33 for an absolute nuke)
* I could have used [Gary hitting 2 homers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ATClynlPY) in Game 2 of the ALDS vs. the Sox, but I try to forget that series
* The [DJ game-tying home run in Game 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4FYRGKiljM) was probably the best moment of the 2018, but it was ruined so quickly after. The [Didi salami](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0jgRW-oh44) in the ALDS was also fantastic

That's it. Alternative title could be I'm bored and I really miss Yankees baseball. Not to show off my young age, but my notes are a little more comprehensive for the more recent seasons.

what is looking good, at least for now, is the return of the prem. a lot of rust and a **bunch** of stupid fuckery leading to some stupid red cards, but there has been some exciting f√∫tbol the past few days. except for that merseyside derby. if you need some sports in your life waiting for baseball to come back or not, this is a good time to get into some premiership f√∫tbol. just know that /u/ajdragoon is going to have some **strong** opinions about who and what you support if it's not in favor of spurs.

Edition","so let's face the unpleasant truth. the chances for baseball in 2020 are pretty much on life support at this point. we're well past the point of starting things to have baseball on july 4. we would not have baseball before the end of july/early august at this point. the owners keep pushing the issue, and the players keep standing their ground, because they should. so, i don't know, fam. it's not looking the best for baseball in 2020.

oh, and [fauci doesn't think baseball should extend into october or november due to covid concerns](https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2020-06-16/anthony-fauci-says-mlb-season-shouldnt-extend-into-october) so that's not great either.

but we, the /r/nyyankees faithful, soldier on, here to shitpost, bitch about the season that wasn't, hate on the astros and redsox, worship at the altar of aaron judge (yes), and have dreams of living in that log cabin. and so we shall continue.

i did this thought experiment as a comment in a previous thread, but i'll offer it here again for more people to see. if you were making a definitive 1990s hip hop playlist, what would you put on it? can be super popular tracks, obscure shit only true hip hop heads would know, hip hop songs that were more popish in nature, whatever. give me 10. let's see what we come up with.

here's my 10 off the top of my head:

1. dr dre - let me ride
2. beastie boys - intergalatic (as was pointed out, everyone who thinks that sabotage is their definitive song is pretty much wrong)
3. nas - new york state of mind
4. wu tang - cream
5. jay-z - big pimpin
6. lauryn hill - everything is everything (mideducation is lowkey one of the top 5 hip hop albums of the 90s)
7. tribe called quest - scenario
8. snoop dogg - gin and juice
9. notorious big - juicy (although i almost said gimme the loot. maybe i just like the ""gimme the loot gimme the loot! hook too much)
10. outkast - rosa parks (i really wanted bob on here. technically it was from 1999, but stankonia didn't drop until late 2000 so i didn't qualify it)

lastly, [join the discord](https://discord.gg/ryHETD). it's grown a lot. plenty of shitposting, animal crossing wholesomeness, and other video gamery going on there. it's fun. we'd love to have you.

1592361195,Old Stadium Seat Restoration Questions,"This may or may not be the right subreddit for this post. I'm restoring an old Yankee Stadium seat from the 1973 renovation. 

Back story: In the 70s my grandfather got two Yankee Stadium seats as part of a Pabst Blue Ribbon promotion. They sat in his office for many years until they were moved to his shed for about 2 decades. He passed away a few years ago and my uncle and I each took one.

I'm new to restoration so I had a few questions I was hoping could be answered here. The frame is very rusty and the wood pieces need to be sanded/painted.

Can I use wire brushes followed by sand paper to clean the rust off the frame and leave a smooth finish for painting?

Is there a particular shade of blue I should look for?

Should I use two different kinds of paint for the frame and the wood or would oil based paint work?

Here are some pictures of what it looks like now:

This letter was from Manfred to the Yankees regarding some rules violations (likely minor) from 2015-16 (not 2017 and beyond). The major lawsuit involved daily fantasy players and the Red Sox and Astros (not the Yankees). It is widely believed that there is nothing in that letter that would look bad for the Yankees. Either way, even if there were, I don‚Äôt really care because we absolutely sucked in 2015-16 and almost every player on the team right now was not on the team back then so this has 0 bearing on our current run of success.

So I was watching the draft with my brother last night and I didn't exactly realize before that that college players use metal bats, not wooden. I expressed skepticism that you can really be sure that metal bat power can translate to wooden bat power, even I can tell that they're very different to use, but he said that it's not that complicated.  

So, I figured I'd come to my favorite and smartest baseball subreddit and ask my questions: What's the practical difference between a metal and a wooden bat? Why do college players NOT use wooden bats? How does hit power translate between the two bats? Historically, has the difference in bats impeded college players from excelling at the professional game?

1591548079,The 2009 Yankees offense was rediculous,"[Here is](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/2009.shtml)[ a link to the full baseball-reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/2009.shtml)[ page on the batting statistics of the 2009 Yankees](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/2009.shtml), but I wanted to pull some tidbits to show just how damn good this lineup was.

1. The worst regular hitter on the team by far was 24-year-old Milky Cabrera. His slash line: .274/.336/.416 with an OBP of about .750. Compared to the other starters on the team he was trash but compared to the rest of the league he was an average hitter.
2. The other 8 starters on the team all had an OPS greater than .850. For reference, a .850 OPS is considered the benchmark for All-Star-Caliber hitting, meaning that 8 of the 9 Yankees starters were hitting at an All-Star level.
3. OPS+ measures a player's OPS relative to the rest of the league, with 100 being average. The lowest non-Milky OPS+ among starters on the team was Johnny Damon at 118. The highest OPS+ was Mark Texiera at 141. Every Yankee starter besides Milky was a well-above-average hitter at worst and an MVP candidate at best.
4. Speaking of Mark Texiera, he led the American League in Home Runs and RBIs on his way to a second-place finish in the MVP voting (those writers love giving Yankees players and managers second place in end-of-season awards). He had a wild slash line of .292/.383/.595 and was an absolute monster for the Yankees in 2009. 
5. Jeter finished 3rd in the MVP voting with a 6.3 oWAR, the highest on the Yankees that year. Arod (10th) and Cano (17th) also received votes. Four of the Yankees 9 starters got MVP votes with Jeter and Teixeira winning silver slugger honors.
6. Once Arod came back from a hip injury partway through the season, he was hitting at an MVP level as well. Arod's slash: .286/.402/.532 with a .933 OPS and 138 OPS+. He topped off a spectacular regular season with one of the greatest postseasons in the history of baseball. His 18 RBIs in the 2009 postseason was one short of the then-record 19 RIBs in one postseason (a record later broken by David Freese in 2011 with 21 RBIs). Arod came through in the clutch time and time again, singlehandedly changing the choke narrative surrounding his career.
7. Murder's row plus Cano: 2009 was a breakout season for Cano. He slashed .320/.352/.520 and he was a 5 bWAR player. That's not bad for a guy who regularly batted in the bottom third of the order.
8. The Yankees offense cumulatively set a new MLB record for home runs in a season while leading MLB in every major statistical category including batting average, OPS, OBP, runs per game, walks, hits, total bases, and many more. This Yankees offense was head and shoulders better than any other in the league.
9. I would feel dirty if I didn't mention Brett Gardner, who wasn't the best hitter on the team but still played in 108 games due to his great defense and speed. Eric Hinskie, Jerry Hairston, and Xavier Nady played well in bit roles. I didn't know this, but Rays manager Kevin Cash played 10 games for the Yankees this year.",self.NYYankees,gyfn2b,21,False,NYYankees

so, the baseball news that we need to discuss and are dreading. the [latest from rosenthal and drellich](https://theathletic.com/1856104/2020/06/04/after-call-with-100-players-mlbpa-position-is-reinforced-they-wont-take-cuts/) (who, along with passan at espn, have been doing top notch reporting on all of this) is making things look bleak. the players, unsurprisingly, are standing firm on not taking another round of pay cuts. it doesn't sound like either side is ready to budge even a little and the labor stoppage that we figured was coming after 2021 may arrive a lot sooner than thought. i would say we have until the end of this weekend for enough positive action to happen to get a season off the ground, but i'm not hopeful.

all this is happening while the nba owners agreed to that odd 22 team thing in orlando, while the knicks can look forward to the ping pong balls not favoring them, because the team will be forever cursed so long as james dolan owns them. also, mls has a deal in place with its union to restart its season. so we may see sports at yankee stadium this summer. it just may not be yankee baseball.

1591207260,/r/NYYankees supports Black Lives Matter,"Hi /r/NYYankees,

Our city and country are mourning senseless acts of police brutality and the systematic and institutional racism that allows for murder and violence to occur against black families without justice. George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery were murdered in cold blood, the predictable consequence of a racist and prejudiced system and culture that treats Black citizens like lesser beings because of the color of their skin. A system that treats Black citizens as the enemy unworthy of the rights that are afforded to them. For those of us who believe that these acts of violence would never occur in a place like New York, we remember Eric Garner, who in 2014 was killed in Staten Island. Officer Daniel Pantaleo put Garner in a chokehold. Pantaleo acted as judge, jury and executioner. Daniel Pantaleo was not indicted for his actions. Our country demands better. We demand better.

This is coming from us far too late. For that, we apologize. We often have sat idly by under the guise that baseball is a form of escapism. Using baseball and other sports to escape daily life is a privilege that is not offered to everyone. Systemic racism and social injustice have to be eradicated. Sports has a critical role to play in creating an equitable society which is intolerant of intolerance.

Things are starting to get spicy in the ""negotiations"" (if they can even be called that) between the players and owners to get the baseball season started. As expected, money is going to be the deciding factor to see if we have a baseball season. The players want (what I believe is fair) prorated salaries based on how many games are played, whereas the owners initial proposal is for a tier list of salary reductions based on the individual salary. The more money you make, the bigger the percentage is that your salary is cut. Pretty easy to see why the players aren't having that. I'm hoping that they're able to come to some kind of deal, but right now things are not looking good.

Discuss that. Discuss how Aaron Judge has impacted your life. Discuss how the Astros &amp; Red Sox are terrible cheating assholes. Discuss how all of these bad events are related to the invention of frisbees. Try not to discuss politics or religion, unless it's about Aaron Judge.

I hope everyone had a great holiday weekend and a good Memorial Day yesterday. Definitely felt weird, as I stayed home and basically stayed in my room as my mom and her fiance had a couple of friends come over and I didn't really want to interact with that. My allergies were acting up, so I had a good excuse to act like a shut-in lol. Btw, first time dealing with seasonal allergies, and all I have to say, is F U C K T H I S.

Hopefully we get some good news regarding the potential start of the season. We already had some good news last week with Cuomo giving the go-ahead for sports teams based in New York to start using their facilities again; parts of California(or just LA, can't remember right now) did similarly.

I really do hope we're able to see baseball again without any potential risk or harm to any player, on any team. While these guys probably have like a .001% chance of having a severe case if they did get the virus, the reports of stuff like glass shard lungs in even mild cases has me wanting to act very cautious. My innate desire for baseball isn't worth these guys potentially losing the ability to play in the future just because we rushed things. Let's hope for the best.

They go to close out and discover that some friends of friends had been charging drinks to her card all day long.  The tab was somewhere around $500, which may not sound like something that'd totally break the bank, but for two kids fresh out of college it was a big deal.  They start bawling.  Suddenly someone taps them on the shoulder and asks, ""What's wrong?  You two are too pretty to be crying like this.""  My gf's best friend was about to tell random guy to fuck off, but my gf told her to stfu.  The guy that she was dating at the time was a GIANT Joba fan, so she knew exactly who he was.  She explained the situation, and not only did he pay the tab for them, he signed an autograph for her then-bf and paid his driver $500 to take them wherever they wanted to go.

1590129108,"Someone asked me to tell a story about Tom, Here‚Äôs a few:","My fianc√© thought I should share some stories about Tom, since I‚Äôve had such a good response on here. 

When Tom was a kid, he saw Pride of the Yankees over 50 times in the theatre.  When he was around 13 years old, the Red Sox and Yankees were already scouting him.  On the day that he graduated from Capitol Hill HS here in OKC, he went back to the house where he had an offer from all 16 teams.  My great grandfather said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a great offers from Boston (88K), STL, and NY Giants. Which one are you going to take?‚Äù  My grandpa said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going with the Yankees.‚Äù  

Another story that I always found hilarious was one time Tom had bases loaded, no outs and was struggling, Billy Martin called time out and went to talk to him.  Billy says, ‚ÄúUpper deck, front row.‚Äù  My grandpa looks up at this real good looking gal and you could see right up her skirt.  Billy starts laughing and goes back to his position.  My grandpa said he was so mesmerized that he forgot that he was even in the game.  Got out of the inning without giving up a run. 

One time when my grandpa was playing for Kansas City, he came back to NY to play the Yankees and he and Mantle went out to dinner the night before and Mickey asked him if he comes in to one of the comes (at this time Tom was a reliever because he had a torn rotator) would he throw him one that he could hit, because ‚Äúwith that shit you got, I bet I can hit it out of Yankee stadium.‚Äù  Lol, well Tom gets in the game and Mantles at bat, and Tom said that he could tell Mantle was really ready and digging in the box.  Tom throws one at Mantle‚Äôs head and yells, ‚Äúfuuuuck youuuuuu!‚Äù  Mantle jumps out of the box and then Tom throws one he could hit out.  He said, ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt hit it out of the stadium though.‚Äù",self.NYYankees,goe47x,1,False,NYYankees

1589173501,Discord - An Update,"Hello donuts, it's your friendly internet memer Centaurius here. By now you've noticed my daily posts about our discord server (if you haven't, honestly, where have you been?). It started out as a place for me to play smash bros with a few people because I was trying to get over a breakup and I wanted other people to play with because of the quarantine. Then we added Mario Kart 8 and Animal Crossing, and it slowly grew. Then we added channels for MLB The Show and for RPGs, and turned it from a Switch-only Discord to a VideoGame-only Discord. It grew some more. Then there were requests to add a channel for talking about alcohol &amp; related things, and the activity has been non-stop.

SO!

After lots of discussion and some sidetracking, I've come to the decision to make the Discord a place for people in this subreddit to get to know others outside of baseball.

FIRST THINGS FIRST, THE RULES:

#1: NO POLITICS
This is self-explanatory. No politics on the subreddit, no politics on the Discord. Talk about that outside of these places if you want to.

#2: NO RELIGION
We may engage in the basic formalities if there is a religious observance that you celebrate, however we will not go beyond that. 

#3: NO BASEBALL
This was debated among us, but we came to the conclusion that baseball should be kept here, in the subreddit. It's inevitable that some baseball discussion will emerge in the Discord from time to time, but we will try to keep that at a minimum.

#4: NO DISCRIMINATION
Racism, sexism, homophobia, and any other forms of discrimination will not be tolerated in any area of the Discord. Period. Full Stop. End of Story.

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, here are the channels we have right now:

-#general: This is where you will be welcomed, where you will get to introduce yourself, where you will see updates and anything else relevant to the Discord as a whole. We also do our Mario Kart discussions here, but that's likely going to change in the next few days.

-#codes: This is where you will post your Nintendo Switch code, to be added by other people.

-#smash: This is where we will have our discussions when we play Smash Bros, as well as anything else Smash Bros related.

-#animal-crossing: This is where we post anything related to Animal Crossing: Daily turnip prices, visiting each other's islands, u/harmony0203 and her random pics of her on her island, that kind of thing.

-#mlb-the-show: This is for everything related to MLB The Show. Card pulls, game mechanics, and anything else related to it. I don't know much about it since I don't play it, but if you do, join in.

-#weeb-bay: This channel was re-named from -#rpgs at the request of u/storm2k. It's basically where we post about things related to RPG games such as Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy, Pokemon, Persona, and other games. Don't worry, you don't have to actually identify as a weeb to join in.

-#the-speakeasy: This is where all alcohol-related things are posted. Some of you might have an interest in such things, others might not. I do not, but others do, so the space has been created for them. Join if you can relate.

-#dining-table: This is where all food-related things will go. Post recipes, what you're cooking for dinner, what you had for lunch, things like that.

-#memes: It is as the name says. Post memes you want to share with people here. No matter how weird or obscure it is, I'm sure someone will appreciate it. 

-#media: This is where you will post about TV, movies, anime, and the sort. If it gets too big, it'll be split into the respective categories, but for now, it's staying in one.

The Discord is a place for you to get to know your fellow Redditors outside of the baseball realm. You will get to have discussions about topics that you would not usually have in the subreddit. It's a chance to get to see a more human side of the people you shitpost with here. You will have to use your reddit username as your discord name, however beyond that, you're free to go wherever you like. We don't get on each other's cases, and I'd like to keep it that way. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or recommendations, feel free to let me know. The Discord has changed so much in the past few weeks, more than I imagined, and I'm open to making it a better place for everyone involved.

1589155481,What‚Äôs your most memorable moment from a game you‚Äôve attended?,"Hard for me to choose just one (Tino Grand Slam in WS, Boone walk off against Wakefield, Arod/Arroyo moment down the 1st line, Jeter‚Äôs 3,000th, etc). There was just nothing like the old Stadium. You could it really feel it shaking. One that really sticks out to me is the Giambi Grand Slam against the Twins. My dad had brought me and my mother to the game, and as everyone knows, the game went into extra innings. If I recall correctly, Giambi got thrown out at the plate in either the 10th or 11th inning, stretching the game out even more. Every inning, as her tire grew, my mother begged for my dad to take her home. In the 13th inning, after what was left of the crowd around us started chanting (playfully) ‚Äútake her home‚Äù, my mother finally got her wish, my dad agreed to finally leave. As we were walking out, and getting in the car, the Twins finally broke through and put 3 on the board. My dad and I were at least satisfied that we didn‚Äôt stay to see the Yanks lose a heartbreaker. But then, they got 3 runners on base. I remember my dad murmuring, ‚ÄúDiann, I swear if he hits a home run here....‚Äù.We got on the highway, and tears started rolling down my eyes and Sterling went on...‚Äùswung on and hit in the air to deep right center. It is high, it is far, it is GONE.  A Grand slam. Ball game over, Yankees win, theeeeeeeeeee Yankees win.‚Äù

1589031811,Dan Otero: the unsung hero of the 2020 Yankees (and other observations from the season),"Roughly a quarter of the way through the Baseball Reference OOTP season and undoubtedly the biggest surprise has been Dan Otero. A veteran reliever who was added for nothing more than depth, Otero has been a weapon: 23.2 IP, 2.28 ERA, 10 K, 2 BB. With the rough seasons so far from Britton, Green, and Kahnle, Otero's contributions have been much appreciated. 

Other highlights so far: 

- Gerrit Cole has pretty much as advertised. 3.07 ERA in 55.2 IP, with a stellar 12.4 K/9 and 2.1 WAR. 
- Overall the rotation after Cole has held steady: Tanaka (3.97 ERA), Loasiga (3.95), and Happ (3.89). 
- Ottavino has been tremendous this season (0.00 ERA in 13.2 IP)
- Bronx Bombers indeed. 12 players have an OPS of .815 or higher and the team has averaged about 6.2 runs/game
- Gleyber Torres and DJ LeMahieu are undoubtedly the best double play combo in the game (combined 4.1 WAR so far)
- Tauchman and Gio have eliminated any doubts about their 2019's being flukes: Tauchman (1.044 OPS, 1.9 WAR), Gio (.889 OPS, 0.8 WAR)
- Judge: 1.3 WAR in 18 games. 
- Yankees have 9 game lead in the East. The focus is not just about winning the division, but making sure we get the best record in baseball. By winning percentage: 

1) Yankees (.711)

2) Dodgers (.676)

3) Braves (.675)

When we heard that the season was going to be cancelled, my friends and I were crushed. We understood the need for it, and have no objections, but the year just wouldn't feel the same without Yankees baseball. My friend KCope decided he was going to simulate the season of Yankees baseball using MLB The Show and Twitch. He doesn't play as either team, but allows the AI to automatically play out each game while he commentates. Games are scheduled to line up with their official original start-times, and are kept accurate to things like location and weather.   


I know it's not real baseball, but my friend has poured his heart and soul into this for months now, broadcasting to just a few of us each game. We have a blast, and I'd love to see the little community he's building gain some more momentum. Here's his link, for anyone who's interested in checking it out.

And while I obviously don‚Äôt want the Red Sox to be better than the Yankees, I don‚Äôt want them to be a horrible team every year because then the rivalry wouldn‚Äôt be any fun. And I don‚Äôt really mind any of their players. Most of them seem to be good people just in a uniform I don‚Äôt like. And I hate when the Red Sox are successful as does any other Yankee fan, but they won their championships fair and square (2018 is a bit of a question mark but the cheating was very minuscule that year and I think the tiny punishment they got was just to make it seem like something in my opinion). I just don‚Äôt feel the same hatred towards the Red Sox anymore compared to how much I hate the Astros. Many of their players just seem like trashy, immoral people who don‚Äôt have any integrity. They cheated the Yankees out of a World Series (most likely twice) and their ‚Äúfans‚Äù just make the entire situation worse. They are a lot like many of the players on the team as many don‚Äôt have any integrity. They just like to brag about a trophy that 29 out of the 30 fan bases don‚Äôt consider legitimate. I was raised as a Yankee fan and have hated the Red Sox my entire life (and I still do) but I just have so much hatred for the Astros now that I currently hate them more.

1588721704,The Astros were already classless before the scandal.,"The Astros were already my least favorite baseball team ever before the scandal because of how those in the organization acted. Sure, Boston may be our rivals, but I never had a problem with any players on the team other than Curt Schilling being a jerk, and how David ‚ÄúBig Needle‚Äù Ortiz went from a pinch hitter in Minnesota to a roided up freak in Boston hitting 54 HRs so I even though I will always root against them, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever hated the Red Sox. Here are some of the reasons why I hate the Astros.

-Carlos Correa who always has something dumb to say like that Apex Predators comment on postgame of ALCS game 6 which screamed arrogance all the while riding Altuve‚Äôs coattails but thinking he‚Äôs the reason why they won despite underperforming year after year batting a measly .270 after being the most hyped 1st overall pick since Harper.

-Alex Bregman who constantly attacks and mocks players like Trevor Bauer and Aaron Judge this past ALCS and doing that bat drop (loved Juan Soto 1-upping him LOL) 

-Justin Verlander who‚Äôs the biggest hypocrite in baseball. He went after other PED users and domestic abusers (I am disgusted with Chapman and German‚Äôs behavior as well.) and rightfully so because both those things are unacceptable, but he didn‚Äôt say anything when his former teammates like Jhonny Peralta were juicing and I can‚Äôt believe he tried defending that poor excuse for a person Osuna by saying that he needed to know more about the situation yet all the evidence showed he did it.

-Yuli Gurriel the racist who thinks that a tip of the helmet to Darvish in game 7 excuses his inexplicable behavior prior.

-Roberto Osuna the wife beater. Enough said. Trust me, I‚Äôm disgusted by Chapman and German‚Äôs actions. It‚Äôs unacceptable.

-George Springer slamming his helmet like a baby when he grounds out and moaning at the plate over balls and strikes all playoffs.

-Josh Reddick calling opposing fans behavior inexcusable yet this guy acts out all the time on the field and is a bonafide scrub.

-A.J. Hinch who always acted smug in interviews and dismissed reporters asked about other teams being suspicious of the Astros shady activity yet he engineered it all with Cora and Beltran.

-Assistant GM Brian Taubman who yelled loudly to a group of female reporters ‚ÄúThank God we got Osuna! I‚Äôm so f***ing glad we got Osuna!‚Äù What kind of low level scum do you have to be to brag about a wife beater? Then in the days following the accusations, he and the rest of the Astros organization denied the allegations until they were caught red handed.

That was before the scandal. After the scandal, I‚Äôve also lost respect for Carlos Beltran‚Äôs involvement, and Jose Altuve for giving empty apologies, acting entitled when being interviewed now, as well as the poor excuses he gives for not wanting his jersey ripped off in celebration.

He‚Äôs done a pretty good job constructing the current roster, but this past decade for the Yankees was a failure, and that starts and ends with Cashman. So, no, he isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúCash God‚Äù.

The Yankees come into this match with a 20-14 record, tops in a crowded AL East.  The Blue Jays sit third with a 16-17 record, 3.5 games back with the Rays sandwiched in the middle.  Both teams starting pitchers have been pretty good on the season in what the fantasy community expects will be a fairly low scoring affair.

There are so many iconic players that have walked through the hallowed halls of Yankee Stadium, both old and new, and donned the greatest uniform in sports, and it's time to determine who is the greatest of all. And if nothing else, it would pass a little bit more time until live baseball is back in our lives again.

Game 2 of the 2007 ALDS at Cleveland, the Yankees were down by a game but up by one run in the eighth inning. Young phenom Joba Chamberlain was on the mound to bridge the gap to Mariano. However, Joba lost it as a swarm of midges overtook the field. The game was stopped briefly, despite the bugs.

1588096142,Jeter‚Äôs 12 year prime was extremely similar to 2019 DJ LeMahieu,"I was just playing around with FanGraphs (as one does in a quarantine with nothing else to do) and noticed this similarity. 

Jeter from 1998-2009: .320/.391/.466, .376 wOBA, 128 wRC+, 5.0 fWAR per season

DJ last year: .327/.375/.518, .375 wOBA, 136 wRC+, 5.4 fWAR

DJ was a bit better in the field, but Jeter made up the gap on the bases. DJ was better by adjusted offense (as a result of Jeter playing through the steroid era), which accounts for the small difference in WAR.

1587935829,Strike Zone height data available on MLB's Stats API,"I need to rewrite my stats pulling data because MLB is moving away from the legacy XML/JSON file-based interface to an API service, so I've been starting to look into the new format of the API responses.

In looking at the player objects, I found this at the bottom of the API response:

    ""fullLFMName"" : ""Gardner, Brett M."",
    ""strikeZoneTop"" : 3.08,
    ""strikeZoneBottom"" : 1.48

Those values for strikeZoneTop and strikeZoneBottom appear to be expressed in feet.  Convert them to inches and they're 36.96"" and 17.76"" respectively.

I got into a batting stance and had my wife measure those points on my body from the floor and they corresponded to my knees and about halfway up my chest.

If you want to browse other strike zones, you can get a list of everyone on the Yankees with this API call:

[http://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/teams/147/roster/depthChart](http://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/teams/147/roster/depthChart)

Then you get a single player's data page with this API call (this one is for Judge)
[http://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/people/592450](http://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/people/592450)

To get data for another player, replace the numeric ID at the end of the call with the numeric ID found on the depthChart page for the desired player in the ""id"" tag:

    ""person"" : {
      ""id"" : 592450,
      ""fullName"" : ""Aaron Judge"",
      ""link"" : ""/api/v1/people/592450""

What I'm taking away from all this is that someone needs to remind the umpires union that the bottom of Aaron Judge's strike zone is 4.68"" higher than the bottom of Brett Gardner's strike zone.

    ""fullLFMName"" : ""Judge, Aaron James"",
    ""strikeZoneTop"" : 3.93,

The Indians are looking for an upset to gain some ground, sitting at 4.5 games back from the Twins in the AL Central.  Both starting pitchers have been strong to start the season, so it could be a good pitching duel.

1587830934,Do we have a KBO team?,"In the absence of MLB games, I'm going to start following the KBO. Have been doing research on all the teams to start narrowing down who I'll be rooting for.

I'm not necessarily looking for the best team, but I do want a team that is run in the same way as the Yankees - nothing is more frustrating than rooting for a team with shit ownership (I'm also a Knicks fan and I know what it's like).

Per my research, there have only been 2 professional Korean players to wear pinstripes - Ji Man Choi and Chan Ho Park. Choi never played in the KBO, and Park had a lot of diarrhea / played for the Hanwha Eagles who are apparently a bit of a shitshow franchise (so very unlike the Yankees). 

I've been digging the Doosan Bears thus far - they are really good, of course, but more importantly, they seem to have their shit together from ownership to front office to the team itself. They're based in Seoul (the NYC of SK!) and are rivals with the Twins. Plus, they have a pretty timeless normcore aesthetic which I definitely appreciate as a Yankees fan. 

I wasn't sure if this sub had officially endorsed a KBO team in the past / if the Yankees have any association with any of the teams - if so, I'd go with whatever team that was without question.

1587602442,Bounce back candidate.. Jonathan Holder?,"He was the butt of jokes last year and became a running gag when Boone put him into high leverage situations. Though he was a key member of the Yankees bullpen in 2018. Was 2018 an outlier or was he unlucky in 2019?

Some of the peripherals in 2019 suggest Holder was unlucky. Despite the 6.31 ERA his FIP was 4.45. His soft contact and barrel percentages were also above average in 2019. Suggesting he wasn‚Äôt really getting tattooed and he was fucked by BABIP.

That being said he is an extreme fly ball pitcher pitching in a ballpark known for home runs to fly. His 0.5 HR/9 in 2018 probably wasn‚Äôt sustainable and it ballooned to 1.7 in 2019. His arsenal of pitches isn‚Äôt exactly impressive. He doesn‚Äôt throw overly hard and his off speed stuff doesn‚Äôt really turn heads. He needs to rely on deception and location to be effective, similarly to Tyler Clippard. 

So what do you think? Can Holder re cement himself as a key part to the bullpen like Kahnle did last year? Or was 2018 a fluke? If there‚Äôs a season or not?",self.NYYankees,g6d27g,5,False,NYYankees

I was at a large luxury department store shopping for loud obnoxious sneakers, a sport coat, a designer Tshirt that cost over $1,000, and pants.

I was shopping with Aaron Boone. He helped me decide what to wear and we went to his condo. I met his wife and he had two little kids, girls under the age of 7, we did a puzzle and hungout then we both got dressed.

He drove me in a Landrover to a red carpet event at Yankee stadium. Turns out it was the 2020 World Series, I was a member of the Yankees (wearing number 36). I was on the bench as an extra infielder for the series. Put on the pinstripes, joked around with Torres. Then hung out on the bench and chatted with Boone throughout the game.

We won the game, it was a Yankees - Reds world series.

But do I hate the Mets? Not really. As fun as it is to make fun of them for screwing up the batting order or their stadium setting on fire or blowing leads all the time or going on 7 game win streaks followed immediately by 18 game losing streaks, they're a likable team. I think their broadcast team is miles better than what the Yankees have to offer on YES and WFAN. Bartolo Colon played for the Yankees but his tenure as a Met was legendary. I don't think there's anyone in the universe who feels bad for Jacob deGrom (well besides the one guy who voted for Scherzer for Cy Young in 2018). Their fans are a million times less toxic than Yankees fans. My two closest friends are Mets fans. (Which is honestly pretty great because whenever we're talking about baseball these days it'll be like ""yankees hit 8 home runs tonight and the mets bullpen blew a 27-2 lead"").

1586974942,Underappreciated Yankees: Elston Howard,"We should have some discussions about former Yankees that we feel should get more recognition. I thought since today is Jackie Robinson Day, I'd talk a bit about the Yankees franchise's first African-American player, Elston Howard. Yesterday was the 65th anniversary of his Major League debut with the Yankees.

Even though Howard's number is retired, Elston Howard seems to be one of the lesser-known Yankee greats. That may not be that surprising, considering he was on teams with the likes of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Roger Maris, Whitey Ford, Moose Skowron, Tony Kubek, and Ralph Terry. But consider that he's apart of the franchise's lineage of catchers, a position that is just as prestigious in the team's history as center field and right field are. 

Elston Howard was born and raised in St. Louis, as did the man he replaced at catcher, Yogi Berra. Howard graduated from Vashon High School after lettering in football, track, basketball, and baseball. He was encouraged by his summer ball coach to try out for the Cardinals, but the team never even considered him, as they did not integrate until 1954. He actually rejected scholarships to play football at Illinois, Michigan and Michigan State to play for Buck O'Neil and the Kansas City Monarchs, perhaps the most famous Negro League team, starring the likes of Satchel Paige, Jackie Robinson, and Ernie Banks. 

After playing three seasons as an outfielder for the Monarchs, the Yankees purchased Howard's contract in 1950. However, he was drafted into the Army and he spent two years in Special Services in Japan, not seeing combat during the Korean War. He was promoted to the Triple-A Kansas City Blues and earned an invitation to Spring Training with the big league club in 1954. He was converted to catcher and was instructed by fellow underrated Yankee great Bill Dickey even though Yogi was at his MVP-peak. Ellie had a breakthrough season in for the Triple-A Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League, batting .330/.380/.569 with 22 HR, 109 RBI, 21 2B, and 16 3B, winning league MVP honors.

Pressure was mounting for further integration for the Yankees, as 12 of the original 16 MLB teams had done so by 1954 after Jackie Robinson first broke the color barrier in 1947 and actually passed on signing Ernie Banks and Willie Mays. Howard earned his way onto the Opening Day roster for the 1955 season. On April 14, 1955, he became the first black player to play for sports' greatest franchise, scoring Mickey Mantle with an RBI single in his first time up after coming in the game in the 6th inning as the left fielder. At Fenway Park. He made his first appearance in the starting lineup at catcher on April 28, filling in for Yogi at catcher and going 3-for-5 with 2 RBI against the Kansas City A's. He hit his first Major League home run in a 4-for-6 performance at Fenway on May 7.  

Manager Casey Stengal originally used Howard as a reserve outfielder, as Yogi was on his way to winning his third MVP in five years. Ellie hit .290/.336/.477 with a 118 OPS+, 10 HR and 43 RBI, and 1.5 bWAR in 305 plate appearances in 97 games in his rookie year. Just as important, the Yankees refused to stay in hotels that wouldn't accept Howard as a guest. In Game 1 of the World Series that year, Howard homered off fellow former Negro Leagues player and Dodgers ace Don Newcombe, but he batted .192/.222/.308 in 28 PAs in the series and was also the final out of for the Dodgers' first and only championship in Brooklyn. The next year, however, Howard homered off Newcombe again in the World Series in his only appearance of the Fall Classic, and Yogi did twice as well as the Yankees avenged their defeat to their archnemeses in a 9-0 Game 7 victory in Brooklyn. 

In 1957, Ellie was named to his first of 12 All-Star appearances. In Game 4 of that year's World Series in Milwaukee, Howard hit a two-out, three-run home run off Hall of Famer Warren Spahn to tie the game in the top of the 9th, a hit that had a WPA of 37%. However, Bob Grim could not hold onto a 5-4 Yankee lead in the bottom of the 10th, and Eddie Mathews walked him off with a two-run HR and the Braves ended up winning that World Series in Game 7 at Yankee Stadium.

After batting .314/.348/.479 with a 130 OPS+ in the regular season, Ellie's finest October moments came in 1958 in a rematch with the Braves. With the Yankees down 3 games to 1 in the World Series, he threw out a couple of important runners in Game 5 and 6. He robbed Red Schoendienst of extra bases and doubled off the runner at first from left field with the Yankees holding onto a 1-0 lead in the 6th inning. He threw out a runner at the plate in Game 6 and scored the eventual game-winning run in the 10th inning. In Game 7, he broke a 2-2 tie with two outs in the 8th inning and scored on Moose Skowron's three-run blast. For his clutch hits and defensive plays to help the Yankees come back from down 3-1 to win their 18th championship and 7th in the previous 10 years, the Baseball Writers gave him the Babe Ruth Award as postseason MVP. 

By 1960, Howard began to take over the regular catching duties as an aging Yogi began to play more in the outfield. He batted just .245 due to injuries despite making both All-Star Games, but he was 6-for-15 in the World Series with 4 RBI, but didn't play that infamous Game 7 after getting hit in the hand with a pitch, which ended with Bill Mazeroski hitting the home run every kid who has ever picked up a baseball has dreamt of hitting for 120 years. 

In 1961, even in a season that was focused on Mantle and Maris' pursuit of the single-season home run record, Ellie had the finest season of his career, batting .348/.387/.549 with a 153 OPS+, all career highs. He also accumulated 5.4 WAR and hit 21 HR with 77 RBI. He caught all five games in the Yankees' thumping of the Reds in the World Series, hitting a homer and doubling three times and scoring five times. In 1962, Howard again hit 21 HR and accumulated 5+ WAR playing in a career-high 136 games, helping the team edge the Twins for another appearance in the World Series. He caught Ralph Terry's famous  1-0 Game 7 victory in San Francisco, in which Willie McCovey was just inches shy of hitting it over Bobby Richardson's head for a series-winning two-run single, the last World Series win for the Yankees of that era.

1963 was Howard's greatest achievement of his MLB career. With both Mantle and Maris missing half the season, Ellie became the focus of the Yankees' lineup for much of the year, and he delivered. He batted .287/.342/.528 with a 141 OPS+ and a career-high 28 HR and totaling 85 RBI and 5.2 WAR. So, he became the first black player to win the American League MVP. He finished third in the MVP vote in 1964, batting .313/.371/.455 with a 127 OPS+ and setting a career-high with a 5.5 WAR, helping the Yankees to their last pennant of this historic era. He managed to win two Gold Gloves in both of these seasons. 

After the 1964 season, Howard's performance began to decline due to injuries, and the Yankees likewise sank into the second division. In August of 1967, Howard was traded to the Red Sox, providing a veteran clubhouse presence that helped guide the team on their Impossible Dream run to the American League pennant on the last day of the season, but Boston lost a tough 7-game series against Howard's hometown team. After the season, the Yankees offered to hire him as a minor league coach, and Bill Veeck offered to make him the first black manager in MLB history if he was able to successfully purchase the Washington Senators (now the Texas Rangers), but he decided to play one more year with the Sox. After retiring, he returned to the Yankees as the first-base coach, becoming the first black coach in the AL. He was on the Yankees staff for 11 seasons, being apart of both the 1977 and 1978 championship runs, providing a calm and peace-making voice on Billy Martin's staff, even cooling down that infamous brawl between Martin and Reggie Jackson at Fenway. 

At the end of his life, Howard had myocarditis, and he passed away at the age of 51 on December 14, 1980. The Yankees officially retired his number 32 and honored him with a plaque in Monument Park in 1984, the same day they also retired his teammate Roger Maris' number 9. 

In addition to his impact on the Yankees' franchise on and off the field, Ellie was also the creator of the batting doughnut, which pretty much helped so many players of all ages learn how to effectively swing the bat more quickly and smoothly. 

Overall, Elston Howard batted .274/.322/.427 with a 108 OPS+ and 27.1 bWAR in 5,845 plate appearances and 1,605 games in 14 seasons in the Major Leagues, mostly with the Yankees. He hit 167 home runs, 218 doubles, 50 triples, recorded 1,471 base hits and 762 RBI He made 12 All-Star teams, won 4 World Series rings as a player and two more as a coach, participating in 13 Fall Classics overall. He played in 54 World Series games, behind only Mantle and Berra for third-most all-time. He played in 8 Game 7s of the World Series, coming out on top in three of them. He was just one of many legendary catchers for this franchise, but his impact on the franchise went beyond his play behind or at the dish.",self.NYYankees,g1xkst,4,False,NYYankees

Sure, it's digital baseball, but we have games to care about as a group here. Tonight, at 9PM, 8PM Central, our resident Looney Tune and Twitch streamer, Tommy Kahnle, plays his first 4 games in the MLB The Show 20 Players League. 

His opponents are as follows:

Vs. Dwight Smith, Jr. ([Baltimore](https://i.imgur.com/SKUKEq0.png))

Vs. Blake Snell ([Rays](https://i.imgur.com/gBfhOiN.png))

Vs. Brett Phillips ([Royals](https://i.imgur.com/7u7mjOr.png))

Vs. Ian Happ ([Cubs](http://i.imgur.com/iR6UF2R.png))

Let's band together, root for our boy, spam all the copypasta we have, and, based on how he plays CoD, hope Tommy's skull doesn't pop right outta his skin if any of these games gets close. 

I am so happy to be back, even in this very different way. I miss baseball and I love you all.

1586405734,"Off Day Thread: April 9, 2020: Let's talk music edition","So early in the year one of the kids who works for me (the last one I would ever expect to care) asked me what my top 10 favorite albums of the 2010s would be and I honestly couldn't answer him. I've been thinking about it and thought I would share, maybe others can find some gems. Also thought it could be a fun ODT. These are totally my personal taste/opinions and based on nothing else. A lot of these surprised me and high school music snob /u/jddrewtyler would have cried.

10. Panic! At The Disco - Pray For the Wicked
Brendon Urie's best work since I write sins.

9. Adele - 21
Adele has been and always will be my guilty musical pleasure that I don't advertise for the world.

8. Falling in Reverse - Fashionably Late
The last ""new band"" that high school /u/jddrewtyler discovered and enjoyed. Ronnie Radke is a total diva and his new stuff sucks.

7. J. Cole - KoD
The album that started my current love for rap music. It slaps from start to finish and makes you think. 

6. Chance the Rapper - Coloring Book
The whole album is a banger but Finish Line is 1 of a kind and sums up my childhood in 2 and a half minutes, so much nostalgia.

5. Nahko and Medicine for the People - On the Verge
Great writer, great musician, great songs. Nuff said.

This is where it got hard.
4. The Weeknd - Starboy
The album has almost no real content but its a banger from front to back and the title track is my most played song of the decade.

3. Streetlight Manifesto - The Hands That Thiele
If you know you know. Tomas Kalnoky is the best writer in the world and it isn't close. You can't change my mind.

2. J. Cole - 2014 Forest Hills Drive
Cole is far and away my favorite artist of the decade. Everything the guy writes is amazing and is 100% real. This and his other albums changed my outlook on a ton of social issues and the word in general.  Love Yourz is my favorite song of the entire decade.

1. Bruno Mars - 24k Magic 
Again, next to zero REAL content but this guy is a modern day Michael Jackson in my humble opinion and this entire album is amazing. Its just so feel good. Its also the only album that makes me want to dance, and if you know me you know that's a big deal.",self.NYYankees,fxln1m,410,False,NYYankees

1586365276,Replaying the 2019 Yankee season with Strat-O-Matic - Results so far,"Hey, r/NYYankees!

Like some of you, I too am stuck inside during these trying times. I purchased my first set of Strat-O-Matic cards this year after finding out about it and thought it would be fun. Who knew I'd have so much time to play it though? For those of you who don't know what that is, it is a card and dice-based board game. You have a pitcher card and a batter card. Roll the dice and it comes up saying strikeout, single, groundball to SS, etc. etc. etc.

To kill some time I have been playing through the 2019 season for the Yankees (as close as I can). Not every player is available in the set, And√∫jar, Bird, Tulowitzki, Higashioka plus others. So in some spots, I've had to move some players around to other spots and change the lineup, Gio had to play games he wasn't in and DJ had to move from 3rd to 1st a few times. I've also played against my Mom a few times, Didi is her favorite player so he also got a few early appearances.

I thought I would share this all with you as it is stats and numbers and things to look over. Here are everyone's stats so far through the first 6 games. These are all the players that are in the set for the Yankees, pitchers and position players too. I score all of the games by hand on paper, recording every play and then put it in this spreadsheet to calculate stats. If anyone is interested in box scores for the games I've done or play by plays then I can try and write those up too.

I hope that some of you find it interesting in this downtime from the season and makes you feel like actual games are happening.

Feel free to ask any questions about what has happened or why I did things the way I did! Also if any numbers don't add up please let me know too.

 Amid the MLB season‚Äôs lengthy delay, the New York Yankees are helping aid the financial toll COVID-19 is having on stadium staff out of work. The team has set up a $1.4 million emergency fund to aid eligible Yankee Stadium workers while the venue is vacant during the interrupted MLB and MLS seasons.

Plan guidelines, as shared by the team‚Äôs official [**Twitter account**](https://twitter.com/Yankees/status/1245759676370817031), apply to full-time and part-time employees of the New York Yankees, Legends Hospitality, and New York City FC. To be eligible, workers must have been scheduled for Yankees and New York City FC games that have been postponed, and completed a set number of working hours during the teams‚Äô 2019 seasons.

‚ÄúThe grants are intended to ease the burden caused by the pandemic associated with essential expenses such as food, medical care, shelter and other vital needs,‚Äù reads the Yankees‚Äô official statement. ‚ÄúOur hope is that these grants will provide a degree of assistance for those[(read more....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/04/yankees-establish-emergency-funding-for-yankee-stadium-workers/)",self.NYYankees,fx9wab,0,False,NYYankees

2) DiDi, traded for him in an old MLB the Show game and was pleasantly surprised with his production. Needless to say that I was hype when he got traded to the Yankees. Still one of my favorite players.

I‚Äôm looking for the community‚Äôs help here. I‚Äôm a freshman in college from Jersey. A teacher of mine, who is also a treasured friend and mentor, is a huge Yankee fan and comes from a family of Yankee fans. He goes above and beyond to care for students. He has been instrumental in my personal development, as well as that of my peers, by leading a debate program at a HS in Jersey which serves many low income families for the past 25+ years. 

He lost his father nearly a decade ago, and while he did not know it at the time, 5/16/2009 was the last game he was able to attend with his father. He is approaching the anniversary of his father‚Äôs death which is a sad moment, and I‚Äôm hoping to buy the scorecard or game booklet or any other memorabilia from that game to give to him in order to help cherish that memory. 

He has expressed that he has always wanted a scorecard of this game, so I really hope that someone here has one/knows a friend with one/can point me in the right direction so I can buy from them. I really want to give back to him. I haven‚Äôt found one in my search so far which is why I am coming to you guys.

Mine:

I grew up in Chicago as a die-hard White Sox fan. (Thus the reddit name). Dressed up as Fisk for Halloween in Kindergarten.

Became totally disenchanted with MLB after the strike in ‚Äô94‚Ä¶ruined a great season for Big Frank. Swore off watching baseball forever.

Then went to NYU in the fall of ‚Äô96. Saw a few games at the ‚Äòold‚Äô stadium thanks to student discounts. Loved the vibe of the place.

Oct ‚Äô96‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúNYU Parents weekend‚Äù‚Ä¶ coming home from a dinner with my folks, walking thru Wash Sq Park‚Ä¶ at the exact moment the Yanks beat the Braves. The whole city IGNITED. Cheers from every balcony up and down 5th Ave. Never heard anything like that before or since.

I‚Äôll never forget, some shady drug dealer in the park yelled out ‚ÄúYankees won the World Series‚Ä¶ all weed half-price!!‚Äù

My parents dropped me off at Rubin, and I met up with all my new ‚Äúlocal‚Äù NY friends. We headed off to The Looking Glass (3rd ave? 2nd ave?) to drink heavily and watch the highlights.

That year and the years that followed, they reminded me of my 90‚Äôs Bulls:  no matter how far they were down, you always HAD to watch, because they would ALWAYS come from behind and win. It was magic.

So, I fell in love with baseball again, with my new Yankees love. Never meant more to me when they came back again and again in the ‚Äô01 Playoffs, giving us and the city the hope we needed. (Can‚Äôt quite recall how the WS ended, tho‚Ä¶.)

I‚Äôve moved on to LA since then, but always make sure to go to the Dodgers/Angels games when they‚Äôre in town. If I have kids here, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll let them choose to pick a local team to root for, but I‚Äôll always educate them on the magical history of the Yankees.",self.NYYankees,ftb49i,22,False,NYYankees

1585600684,"In a tied Postseason Game, Who Do You Go To, Masahiro Tanaka or Orlando Hernandez?","Masahiro Tanaka and Orlando Hernandez have had similar career paths in their Yankee years. International free agents who dominated in their native country, before coming over to America. Both have had solid regular season performances that have seen plenty of lows, but also plenty of highs. What has endured both these players however is their consistent postseason success. Tanaka is still an active pitcher for the Yankees, so his story is still being written. Never the less, I think he's accrued a decent enough amount of postseason work. So the question I ask you guys here at Yankees reddit, in a 1-1 postseason series (you can decide which series it is), who has your complete trust, Masahiro Tanaka or Orlando Hernandez to tip the series back in the Yankees favor? 

**The Case for El Duque:** 

Orlando ""El Duque"" Hernandez joined the Yankees in the historic 1998 season. He enjoyed a successful postseason run with the Yankees that year, starting one game in the ALCS and one in the World Series. In both games he went seven innings, and allowed only one earned run. That was just a taste for what was to come next year. Hernandez won the 1999 ALCS MVP, throwing 15 innings of three run ball against the Red Sox. He also threw 7 innings of one run ball against the Braves that year. Overall, Hernandez pitched in 19 postseason games with the Yankees, of which he started 14 of them. He enjoyed a 9-3 record with a 2.55 ERA. Compared to Tanaka, El Duque has started 11 more games so he has a lot more games under his belt, and therefore, more consistency. 

Link to El Duque's Best Postseason Start: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbD7QdxVgEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbD7QdxVgEA)

**The Case for The Blaze** 

Masahiro Tanaka joined the Yankees as an international free agent prior to the 2014 season. The Yankees didn't make the playoffs that season, but Tanaka earned Joe Girardi's nod to start the do or die Wild Card game the next year against the Astros. Two years later, Tanaka pitched a 1.38 ERA across three starts in the 2017 postseason. Two of those coming against the eventual World Series Champions\* Astros. Tanaka only had one start in the 2018 postseason, however, it came against the eventual World Series Champions\* Red Sox in which Tanaka only allowed 1 run en route to the only Yankees win that series. In 2019, Tanaka pitched to a 2.12 ERA. In particular, he pitched a stellar Game 1 against the Houston Astros, shutting the eventual World Series contending team down for six 1 hit innings on just 69 pitches. Overall, Tanaka has started 8 postseason games for Yankees with a 5-3 record and 1.76 ERA. That ERA currently ranks him 12th all time with pitcher who have thrown at least 40 innings. While he doesn't have as many starts as Hernandez (he will in time!), what he's done in those eight starts is nothing short of incredible.

One of the few podcasts I like to keep some sort of a pulse on mentioned recently Martin Scorsese movies and how some of his older films were comprised of soundtracks featuring the works of such greats as Jerry Vale, among others. So for those not familiar with the origins of the John Sterling homerun call for Giancarlo Stanton comprised of ""...non dimenticar that ball sure traveled far..."" here is the song (mostly in Italian) that is responsible for that moment I cannot wait to experience at some point in 2020 once this is all behind us.

1585262131,I made some things!,"...so the original plan was to share these with all of you today, but even though there's no actual baseball to display on them, I am hoping that some of you get a good, nostalgic feeling from this.

I built replicas of the Yankee Stadium scoreboards from the renovated Yankee Stadium - the Out of Town scoreboard from the left field corner and the line score scoreboard in left field.

They pull data live from MLB.com, using the same data that powers Gameday, so they're very up-to-the-second in a live-game situation.

[Here is a picture and a video](https://imgur.com/gallery/wrhXQTy) of the scoreboards displaying the slate of games from today.  As you can see, all the games on the OOT scoreboard are **P**ostponed

I'm lucky enough to have a job that allows me to work from home and luckier to work in an industry that's needed even in these times, so at the moment my work situation is stable.  I have been up early most mornings tinkering with the scoreboards before starting my day.  I then leave them on because hey, there's no other clock in my basement - so it's functional!

The desktop program always defaults to the current day's slate of games and always puts the Yankee game on the board first.  When MLB canceled Spring Training, all the rest of the Spring Training scheduled game information disappeared from their servers, so the scoreboard would come up empty - just the time, the SEIKO and OFFICIAL TIME, the headers for the innings and the R H and E would light up.

But this morning when I powered it up I was greeted by the Yankees - Orioles game and was confused for a moment until I realized that today was supposed to be opening day.  The Championship Season data, of course, is still on the servers.

Ruined my *entire* morning.

So I hope some of you get some measure of happiness by looking at these.  Sad as I am that there won't be any real games to follow with them for at least 6 or so weeks, it still made me happy the first time I put them both side-by-side, turned them on, watched them come to life and let them run through [the games on the first day of the London series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jlgXtr0YTQ).  A Boston ass-kicking seemed like a fitting christening.

I'll be on and off Reddit most of the evening, so if you have any questions about them please don't hesitate to ask - I'll answer as best as I can. If I don't get back to you immediately please be patient - I'm probably spending time with my wife!

I can edit the post or sticky a comment each day with the results from all of our games. I can also post standings daily and some key stats.

**MARCH 26 RESULTS:**

**Yankees 10, Orioles 5** 

The New York Yankees start off the 2020 season right, with a 10-5 victory over their AL east counterpart Baltimore Orioles. 

It was a big day for Brett Gardner, as he homers twice and induces a Gardy Party. Gary Sanchez was not so lazy today, as he had multiple extra-base hits. Thicc Boi Luke Voit and Miguel Andujar also homered.

In a rather underwhelming start in Pinstripes, Gerritt Cole allowed 5 runs (4 earned) in 6.2 innings. Zack Britton and Dan Otero (wut) do a great job in relief, combining for 2.1 scoreless innings. 

**OTHER NOTABLE GAMES**

He didn't have every player's auto card but he had the expensive ones and I was able to pick up the ones I was missing on eBay.  All are authenticated autos from card companies except Duncan.  I couldn't find an ""official"" one of him in a Yankee uniform so bought one a fan supposedly had autographed in person for a couple of bucks.  Rivera is in the same card holder as Wetteland but I left Wetteland showing because he got the save.

I would avoid the obvious games such as the 2017 wild card game, or David Cone perfect game, but instead post games that were either really good but possibly forgotten, had really good moments or milestones that aren't quite as memorable as the huge ones, and maybe even throw in one or two Yankee losses that were still really close games, that way there's some risk for new viewers and emotional investment.

You may know me as the Minecraft Yankee Stadium guy. There‚Äôs a reason I haven‚Äôt been able to do much more lately. I‚Äôve been busy with work and school. I was going to try and get some done over the quarantine, but my laptops hard drive suddenly failed. The hard drive keeps almost all the files on the computer. For the most part, Minecraft worlds are linked to the computer, not the account. So I don‚Äôt know if I can get it recovered.

In an attempt to fix my laptop myself I also messed up the charging port, mouse pad, SSD, and keyboard response time. How? I have no clue, guess I shouldn‚Äôt fix stuff myself.

So I guess I just should give an update. I‚Äôm bringing the computer to a local shop, hopefully he can fix it, but if not, the laptop and world may be gone. It‚Äôs an expensive laptop because it has an i7, which is why it‚Äôs able to run Minecraft, about $750 for me, so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to afford a more expensive machine.

1585071830,Re-watching Game 5 2012 ALDS,"Here's the [game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRyhHSImzl0) on Youtube

First off, what a fucking performance by CC: 

9 IP, 4 H, 1 ER, 2 BB, 9 K, 121 pitches

Was cool to see the dude still able to pump mid 90s fastballs (struck out Chris Davis in the 9th with a 93 MPH heater). And looking at CC's career, it was kinda the end of the version of CC that could overpower guys. Then we saw him struggle from '13-'15, and then enter the Andy Pettitte cutter phase of his career from '16-'19. 

Some other notes: 

- Interesting to look at some of the guys in both lineups. Machado was just 19 years old! Nate McLouth, forgot about that dude. Eric Chavez on the Yankees
- Alex Rodriguez not in the lineup. You all probably remember, Raul Ibanez pinch hit for A-Rod in the 9th inning of Game 3 (he would hit the game tying and game winning HR's). A-Rod in the four games: 2-16 with 9 K. Obviously 2009 A-Rod will always be in my heart, but he was absolutely terrible from '05-'07 and '10-'12 in October ('04 he was great). 
- Last time seeing Jeter playing at his top level. Was kind of a bummer knowing he was going to fuck up his ankle in the next game. But 2012 Jeets was tremendous: 159 games played as a 38 year old, 216 hits, hit .316, 7th in MVP voting
- Ichiro in pinstripes. He was huge for us down the stretch, hitting .322 after being traded. 
- Just in general, it was bittersweet watching the last gasp of this particular championship window ('09-'12). It was a solid 4 year run. 

If anything, just go back and re-watch it for CC's performance. It was an old school, bulldog type mentality that I think Cole is going to give us when we play in October.",self.NYYankees,fo9e3f,5,False,NYYankees

Last year I was part of a research project that looked at various factors that can lead to sporting success, part of which saw our team tasked with putting together detailed data on the most successful  sporting clubs across the world in every team sport! Here is our data for baseball.

We looked at every competitive baseball league across the world, taking into account all officially recognized trophies. For MLB teams, this encompasses the World Series (Commissioner's Trophy) and either of the National League pennant (Warren C. Giles Trophy) and American League pennant (William Harridge Trophy). Abroad, it encompasses all domestic league championships as well as any domestic cups and continental competitions that are part of the domestic calender (as some countries abroad, particularly in Europe, do not have a playoff system that determines the national champion and instead crown the winner of what would be the 'regular season' in the US and institute an entirely seperate domestic cup competition on the side that runs parallel with the league championship). Non-competitive awards such as pre-season/friendly competitions as well as unofficial awards such as divisional series and wildcard qualification berths in the MLB are not counted as they are not recognized as titles by their respective league and you do not physically get anything for them.

As you can see the Yankees sit comfortably in 1st place, roughly 10 trophies ahead of the second and third placed teams and miles in front of fourth place and below!

These are the two biggest criticism of the guy from Yankees fans:

1. He took the money and ran: I personally will never fault a man for taking $60 Million extra to do the exact same job in another place. He spent 9 years with us! Maybe we are spoiled by the core 4 but players in the free agency era don‚Äôt usually stay with one team for that long. 

2. He‚Äôs lazy: I‚Äôve seen this leveled against many latin players in the org (El Gary for example) and it feels a little racist. You can just wipe away all of his amazing performances just because the dude didn‚Äôt run out ground balls. It‚Äôs just silly.

Both teams are .500 but the Yankees are trying to avoid a sweep at the hands of their crosstown rivals and avoid losing their 5th in a row. Their last win was a 20 - 11 win over Tampa Bay but since then the Bronx Bombers have gone cold at the plate.  On the mound for the Yanks is 41 year old lefty Randy Johnson on the mound who is 7-5 with a 4.20 ERA.  If the Yankees want to win this game it might be from Alex Rodriguez who's an early MVP candidate batting .330 with 20 Home Runs, and 64 RBI.

Right now with Severino out for the season, Paxton out, German out, Hicks out, Judge out, Stanton out I am starting to get a bit worried (and the season didn't even start yet). 

The Yankees did sign the best possible starter in de majors and did do pretty well last season despite on all the injuries. But the team's depth is not as good as it was last season. With Maybin, Romine, Didi and Betances a lot of players that filled last years gaps nicely, left the team and no one to return in there place.

That's the ONLY way the Yankees ever will make up for 2004 in my eyes and many other fans' eyes and I'll never personally be able to get rid of my childhood demons and be completely satisfied with my life again unless this action occurs and the Yankees manage to pull this amazing achievement against the Red Sox.

We played a part in the 2001 World Series loss by pitching a terrible Game 1 in that series, he played a part in the 2004 collaspe by losing Game 5 for the Yankees in the 2004 ALC's after their Game 4 loss.

It's not a coincidence at all that when the Moose finally decided to hang it up and retire from baseball that the Yankees won a World Series a year after his last season with the Yankees.

This might be my first post here not sure yet. 

My GF is an AVID Yankees fan. We've basically seen at least one game every year since we started making enough money to go on vacation. 

I'm not going to lie, I've been born and bred in New England my entire life but her Yankees fandom has more or less even converted me!

Anyway, were going to see the Yanks vs the Stros in September and the plan *was* to go on our anniversary. The 24th. So I bought Champions level seats because back in February at the time, they were going for 200 buck lol! Either that or I got scammed. Cut to -- yesterday, when my beautiful wonderful GF told me she now really wants to go on the 23rd too. The day before our anniversary.

She'll definitely love the Champions seats (I hope!). But my question for y'all is:

**What's a good seat to buy that isn't quite as good as champions level but also plenty entertaining? I'll admit it's really not the best formed question üò£ especially as we've sat in most of the sections before. Any responses will do l, though. The champions section we bought was section 11 row 1, seats 1&amp;2. So, if that's like 9/10 for seats, what's your 8/10??",self.NYYankees,fg4bi7,2,False,NYYankees

1583616838,Not gonna lie the injuries don‚Äôt bother me we get to see the kids play,"Yanks have such great depth because of trades, signings, and drafting it really showed last year with all the injuries but it just seems like every injury just makes the team stronger as more guys get a chance to develop their game at the MLB level but usually kind of a low pressure spot batting 8th and 9th and pitching as the 5th starter or low pressure reliever and with a nice extended look so they get a chance to get comfortable.

Let's say worst case scenario he needs surgery and is out for half the season or more. This happened last year as well and would be a trend. Do you think this impacts the Yankee's future plans with him? Would they let him walk when it comes to his eventual mega deal? What would you guys do if you were in that situation with limited funds (as we all know exists) and you had such a large question mark like Judge ready for a massive contract?

Aaron Judge | Stress fracture in first right rib | Judge fractured his rib on September 19, 2019 diving for a ball and was shut down for 2 weeks from today (March 20). Surgery to remove the rib would be on the table if rest does not fix it. Judge himself says the doctors told him he was already in the ""middle part"" of his healing process.
James Paxton | Cyst in lower back | Paxton had surgery to remove a cyst in his lower back on February 5. The timetable for return was May or June, but Paxton began doing range of motion exercises with a medicine ball on March 5 and hopes to begin his throwing program this weekend or early next week (March 7-11).
Luis Severino | Torn UCL (Tommy John surgery) | Severino had Tommy John surgery on February 27 and will likely be out until mid-2021.
Giancarlo Stanton | Grade 1 calf strain | Stanton strained his calf during outfield drills on February 25. Typical recovery time for this injury is 7-14 days, but Stanton will still likely not be ready for Opening Day because he will need to ramp up.

Let's also talk about that awesome feeling that my dad and my 9-year-old-self felt as Yankees fans back in the fall of 2004 when the Yankees were about to completely sweep a far superior Boston Red Sox in the Game 4 of the ALCS with only three outs away to end the game with Rivera on the mound at Fenway Park...until all of sudden all of the players were called off the field for no apparent reason and Major League Baseball decided to cancel the rest of season for no apparent reason and everything just became awkward.

Now why did the MLB decide to do this???  That, us Yankees fans will never know. But that doesn't matter...what was it was incredibly fun and memorable year for Yankees baseball and 2004 was great time for my personal life and childhood.",self.NYYankees,fe64au,5,False,NYYankees

Todays showing was absolutely appalling like one of the worst pitching performances in a long time. It was Price tier pitching from Cole, and it was sad. Sad that we are gonna probably not just lose the World Series this year buy likely the East as well, likely because instead of working on other aspects we wasted money on Cole. 

Cashman should also he fired for making such a shit deal, he is the worst GM in baseball and the worst GM in history and this whole fiasco proves it. Sack him NOW

Overall Im just so dejected. Seeing that game it was like watching us lose everything before the first pitch of opening day was even thrown.

1583107503,How much of the Yankees‚Äô injury woes fall on Cashman?,"I am seeing most people either putting the blame on these players being perennially injured on the training staff or ‚Äúbad luck‚Äù. There‚Äôs credit to both of these, but I also believe Cashman should be footing a decent amount of blame for this too. 


Cashman was the one who decided to invest in these players. Both Aaron Hicks and James Paxton, while solid, logical trades that should have been made, were historically known as injury prone before they were Yankees. 


In James Paxton‚Äôs career he has never thrown more than 160 innings in his 7 years in the majors. Around 200 innings is considered a season‚Äôs worth. 


Aaron Hicks was given a 7 year contract despite never playing more than 137 games. He also has been in the majors for 7 years. I would consider a full season to be 145+ games. 


Giancarlo Stanton is another extremely injury prone player Cashman decided to invest in.


In 2012 he missed 40 games with a knee injury and an abdomen strain.
In 2013 he missed 50 games with shoulder, thigh, and ankle injuries.
In 2015 he only played 70 games because he broke his wrist swinging a bat.
In 2016 he missed 25 games with a hamstring strain.
In 2018, he couldn‚Äôt play the on the field half the season which led to Shane Robinson and Neil Walker playing the outfield.
He essentially missed all of 2019 and is looking to miss more time in 2020. He‚Äôs essentially been injured half his MLB career. 


Another argument I see being thrown around is ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt care. Rather them injured now than in October!‚Äù. However as a result many of these players are extremely rusty when then get back. And it sucks when you can‚Äôt watch half of the recognizable roster the majority of the season.


With the addition of Severino being injured for the majority of his new contract, I believe Cashman needs to be much more careful when considering the upcoming contracts of Judge and Sanchez. Judge seems to becoming more and more injury prone and it appears his career path seems to be shadowing the trajectory of Stanton‚Äôs. In addition, Gary Sanchez injures his groin multiple times a year and takes weeks to months to get back to form.",self.NYYankees,fc38kd,8,False,NYYankees

Things looked too crowded for Red October to get in to the lineup, but now it seems he may get another shot at the start of the season.

Will this finally be Clint's time to shine?   He's way past the concussions now and should be as ready as he'll ever be to claim a major league spot for keeps.    Can he show some consistency in the OF?  Can he rake?

I think the answers are yes and yes, and he could spike his value big time if so.   Then when you get Judge and Stanton back you're in a spot where you have more ammo to go get a SP if needed.

Both Clint and Miggy could really see their stock rise if they both answer any lingering ?s by getting off to hot starts.",self.NYYankees,fakm2m,27,False,NYYankees

1582830016,Petition to Rename the IL Back To The DL,"Prior to the beginning of the 2019 season, the MLB decided to change the name of the Disabled List (DL) to the Injured List (IL) for inclusivity reasons.  While a seemingly harmless change on the surface, since this change the Yankees have incurred an unprecedented level of injuries, setting a record for most players on the list last year and already having lost multiple starters prior to March this season.  I'm not a doctor, but this doesn't seem like a coincidence to me.  I propose we revert the name back to the DL and return to pre-IL-level injury rates.",self.NYYankees,fagyjg,0,False,NYYankees
1582829579,"The Nazi mods on /r/baseball won't let me post this, but I created two new stats based on baseball stats","So I was completely bored at work yesterday, and I got the amazing idea to create these stats based on this post I saw on this sub about KAR(Karma Above Replacement level). Now obviously the post was a joke, but I said, hey, what if there were competitive stats to measure against other Redditors? So I went to work. 

Note: I am the absolute furthest thing from a statistician on this Earth, but I used every bit of my C- average knowledge in high school stats to create these two stats after much trial and error. 

So without further ado, here are my two stats:

The first is Posting Average, based obviously on Batting Average. 

So the formula for BA is simple with it being Hits/At Bats, so I determined that for our purposes, ""hits"" should be karma(in this case it'd be total combined karma, post, and comment) and AB should be total posts. And to get a number less than 1, we'll use my added wrinkle of how many years old the account is in days. For example, my account is 7 years old, so 365 x 7 would be 2555. 

So the formula would be [Total karma √∑ total posts] √∑ Days.

So, for instance, my total karma is 540,953 and my total posts are 1,614 and the total days of my account are 2555. So using my formula, you'd get my Posting average of .131

Now for something a little more advanced:

This one is called Karma Percentage or Karma Average, and it's based on Slugging Percentage. 

One of the forumlas for Slugging Percentage is ([Singles] + [Doubles x 2] + [Triples x 3] + [Home Runs x 4])/[At Bats]. 

So I created my formula for Karma Percentage: ([Total posts below 100] + [Total posts below 1000 x 2] + [Total posts above 1000 x 3] + [Total posts above 10,000 x 4]) √∑ [Total posts]

So again, using my own stats as an example here's the formula: ( ( 723 ) + ( 777 √ó 2 ) + ( 98 √ó 3 ) + ( 2 √ó 4 ) ) √∑ 1614 =‚Ä¨ 1.597

So I have a Karma Percentage of 1.597 

In conclusion, I most assuredly did some math wrong, and probably violated a few statistic principles, but I think these stats are fairly interesting, and I'm proud of them. If nothing else, this whole process helped me kill a few hours. 

So if you have any ideas, comments, criticisms or improvements you'd like to make, please, by all means, comment below.

But if the investment never plays, what's the point? I just want to see these guys go out there and play baseball. Power through some pain, and give us 140+ games.

1582674599,Lets Have an Honest Talk about Christopher Ahmad,"He's been the Yankees team doctor since 2009 and over the past 10+ years, we have essentially had one injury debacle after another with issues often pointing directly back to the medical staff. The fact that our medical staff misdiagnoses multiple injuries every season is extraordinarily troubling in and of itself (and lets not forget the embarrassment of watching one of our past star players go out of his way to pursue a lawsuit against Dr. Ahmad for medical malpractice). This organization has went out of its way to use Ahmad and his staff to perform nearly all player surgeries, even when there are available outside options (Dr. James Andrews for instance) with such impeccable reputations that other organizations across the league utilize. 

Most people here (myself included) are not claiming to be medical experts in any way or have familiarity with everything Dr. Ahmad does when it comes to evaluating and treating player injuries. With that said, we've reached a point where regardless of how much of this is Dr. Ahmad's fault, it's clear that there remain issues with the Yankees medical staff and as the person in charge, Dr. Ahmad has some culpability.

I hope the Yankees decide to do a further overhaul of their medical staff and make any needed further changes before further irreversible mistakes get made.",self.NYYankees,f9jsgv,19,False,NYYankees

1582561769,Spring Training Logistics - 2020 intel sharing,"Hi all - 

First time return to Spring Training since Ft Lauderdale days in the 1980s. Here's some quick info and intel on what I experienced on Saturday in Tampa:

1. Parking is offsite: Parking is across the street in the football stadium @ $10 - if you turn into Steinbrenner Stadium Road then you're going to be turned around as the lots on premise are handicapped. Bring cash
2. Training is accessible without a ticket: Pregame warm-up (2-3 hours ahead of game time) can be accessed without a ticket across the way from the stadium. You can get really close up to the players and interact (Boone waved to me after I complimented him on his lack of sleeves - I was in a vest too), and the kids grabbed a few autographs (Trey Amburgey was super nice) - bring pens and balls. Agents were there and also talking to the kids - so was really a great experience.
3. There's a kids tent and pitching station: They run a tent for the kids for where the players walk off the field - no parents allowed - they can talk to the players and get autographs. Only a few players do this but my son had a few moments w Ottavino and got his autograph
4. They are checking bag size: They gave me crap about my backpack being 1"" over but a female guard intervened as I was carrying food and clothing for the kids 
5. Food and beverage are awesome: Lots of options on top of the standard Bronx fare - especially meatless / plant-based burgers and dogs. Pizza was better too.
6. Main store is great: Lots of Spring Training march - can already see the Nike inflation tho (shirts and jerseys). Store is accessed only with a ticket on gameday
7. Sit close to the Bullpen: Lucked out here - wanted to be by Judge, but alas wasn't possible. We were able to interact with ALL of the pitchers and catchers (Ort is looking really strong), and got 1 ball for my friend's kid (first baseball game ever), and another 2 for each of my kids

We could have spent an extra day at Disney, we were disappointed by Judge not playing BUT the interaction with the players and being able to hear EVERYTHING on the field was baseball like I've not experienced it in a while. 

On another note, apparently there was ""a Yankee pitcher who is Dominican"" on our Delta flight back to LGA in First Class that we only found out about as we deplaned...kinda disappointed in finding that out then as we were all in Yankees hats and in 11th Row - maybe Sevy or German?

1582558526,What questions about this team would you like to see answered in the 2020 season?,"Obviously this year is about winning the world series. This team has the highest expectations since 2009, but what secondary questions do you think are important going forward? For me, I'm interested in finding out

1) Can key players stay healthy? Judge, Sanchez, Hicks, Stanton, Sevy. They all seem to miss a significant amount of time each year. We've got a new training guru on board and I'd really like to see everyone (once they come back) stay healthy outside of the normal minor injuries.

2) Can Stanton handle LF? He was an NL guy and I know he was at DH a lot in 2018 because he had some nagging injuries he played through because they needed him to, but he was always a good fielder. I'd like to see him out there 2/3 of the time.

3) Where will these young pieces fit in going forward? Urshella, Andujar, Tauchman, Frazier, even Voit. We have some players that are going to potentially start getting expensive. Is Voit a long term option or just good for now while he is cheap? Were Urshella and Tauchman rabbit ball flukes? Can Tauchman at least take over the backup CF role going forward given Hicks isn't going anywhere? Can Andujar and Frazier improve their defense enough? With Hicks out the first (hopefully just) month or two I'd like to see these players get time so these questions are answered by the deadline.",self.NYYankees,f8sxl5,7,False,NYYankees

1582467650,Cheap Hal needs to televise the games,"Okay, fans.  You tell me: why aren't we seeing Yankees games on tv this spring?

We're not even seeing them on MLB.TV, unless they're produced by the opponent.

Here we are, in a spring of the Rangers conducting a fire sale and the Knicks pretending to play basketball, and the Yankees are not taking advantage of it by televising their games.

No room on the YES Network because of conflicts with the self-promoting Michael Kay Show and other low-rated daytime fillers?  Fine, then put it on Yankees.com as an internet broadcast, which would certainly drive more traffic to the web site (and generate more ad revenue, something the suddenly money-challenged Steinbrenners should love).

It's pathetic that teams like the Blue Jays and Orioles, let alone the arch-rival Red Sox, are available almost daily, but we can't watch the Yankees.  Coming on the heels of the cries of poverty used to excuse the decision to not even make offers to the starting pitchers and position players who would have made the Yankees the favorites in the East, and boost ticket sales the way the signing of a certain outfielder has done 85 miles to the south, it's just another sign of a return to the CBS era of ownership.

I can't speak for anyone else, but my season tickets have gone up the maximum 4.5% again, so they're now at $256/ticket/game.  Sure, they're great seats (117-A, Row 8), but this will likely be our last year because the Steinbrenners are pricing us out (and i've been in comparable seats behind the Yankees dugout since 1986 as an individual, never business-paid, licensee) -- and doing nothing to improve the team or truly make ownership worthwhile (yes, they did add one nice perk this year: a subscription to MLBTV is now included at no extra charge -- but you can't watch the spring training games so far, in a ""the Hal giveth, the Hal taketh away"" mode we've come to endure).  Those seats should be $150, perhaps $175 per game.

The Yankees crying poverty and expenses, when the cheapest soda in the ballpark is what, $6?  Cheapest beer is $8?  Popcorn, which costs next to nothing at wholesale, $7.50 for a bucket and $5 for a small box with so much salt you don't even know what you're eating?

Did someone say ""pay toilets installed in the men's restrooms this year...women's restrooms will be done next year because the Yankees didn't have the money to install the coin machines in their 2019 budget?""

But back to the lack of televised spring training games.  Aren't Kenny Singleton, Michael Kay and company already down there, anyway?  And if they're not, I'm sure that the announcer for the Tampa Yankees would be glad to gain the experience, and probably do the games for next to nothing.

And that's about what we're getting from the Yankees these days -- A lot of NEXT TO NOTHING!

We get it, there's outrage. Outrage at the lack of accountability, outrage at the lack of punishment, outrage at the lack of contrition, outrage at that little shit Altuve holding the 2017 MVP, or outrage over that hypocritical jackass Verlander suddenly being silent after being the voice of fairness and indignance in the past. I have certainly felt my fair share of this outrage, but at a certain point, we have to look at the subreddit we have in front of us. The front page is, and this is not an exaggeration, over 90% Astros related, and this is with good reason: because they're a bunch of cheating shitbags. It's all-engulfing, and the drama is not burning out, but instead becoming an ever-increasing echo chamber of toxicity and Fuck the Astros, and the mood is extremely negative on the subreddit. And, more importantly, nobody is actually talking about the thing we're here for, which is Aaron Judge. Yes.

Judge is the rightful 2017 MVP whether we want to go by WAR, overall offensive numbers, or just being the best player in the league. Also he isn't a little cheating shit that should be shoved into a trashcan.

Let's get back to what we all really love around here - which is Aaron Judge. Yes. 

And fuck the Astros. Fuck Altuve, fuck Bregman, fuck Verlander, fuck Correa, fuck the rest of em, and fuck the idiots who report posts about the Astros as targeted harassment. 

Also today's the last day before televised baseball. Talk about stuff here, bring your shitposts and memes, and politics and religion talk are only okay if they're about God-President Aaron Judge.",self.NYYankees,f767ho,443,False,NYYankees

On his damn birthday no less. The Baseball Gods can be cruel and unforgiving.

[No further tests are planned for Sevy, but he has been put on anti-inflammatories](https://twitter.com/lindseyadler/status/1230573687423852544) and is scheduled to see the team doctor as early as today for further evaluation.

With Paxton and Hicks already scheduled to miss time, it's beginning to feel like the worst kind of Deja Vu all over again for Yankees fans, who on the eve of Spring Training games officially kicking off, are already bracing for one of the most important pieces of a championship-caliber squad to miss time.

In slightly better news, [Aaron Judge (Yes.) is scheduled to start hitting again today](https://twitter.com/YankeesWFAN/status/1230569023869530112?s=20) after a scare Monday involving his *own* shoulder soreness.

Last night, the Devils beat the Sharks 2-1, and the Nets lose their first game back from the ASB in Overtime to Philly 112-104.

Tonight, the Rangers look to continue their hot streak down in Carolina, the Islanders are home against Detroit, and it's [Friday Night Knicks](https://youtu.be/vz969f_3e34) at the Garden against the Pacers.

There‚Äôs no glaring weakness even if the line up is a bit right handed heavy and health is a bit of a question. The amazing depth already proved good enough to endure any personnel losses.

**Aaron Judge** \[Interview\] \[New York Yankees\] - ""To know that we were probably cheated out of a possibility of making it to the World Series. As a kid, forget about the individual awards.  Forget about how many games you win, how many homers you hit. It's about winning a World Series with your team and fighting until the end and to be the last team that's standing. To hear that you got cheated out of that opportunity, that's tough to let go.""

""Wasn't a fan of the punishment. I thought that was a little weak for a player driven scheme that no players involved got any punishments. With Bellinger, I agree with a lot of the things he said. He went out there and spoke his mind, and I really don't want to get into the whole if Altuve stole the MVP or not because it really doesn't matter. It's over with.

""They were questioning us, kind of half joking, ‚ÄòWhat are you guys doing? You guys are hitting the crap out of the ball.' That should have been the smoke right there.¬†Obviously, they were doing something themselves, and they probably felt we were.""

""It‚Äôs an integrity and accountability issue. What was their excuse ‚Äî because (they thought) everybody else was doing it? That‚Äôs the part I get into a problem with.

I am playing trivia at a local bar and wearing my Yankees hat as always. There‚Äôs a player at another table wearing a Dodgers cap. After handing in my answer, I detoured by their table to make nice and have a moment over our teams doing it right and potentially seeing each other in the World Series... or so I thought.

It started out fine. I smiled, pointed to the hat on my head, then pointed at hers. She smiled, acknowledged, gestured in a good-natured way. I extended my hand and said, ‚ÄúPerhaps we‚Äôll see you in October!‚Äù She smiled and agreed. All going as expected.

I turned to leave but turned back and said, ‚ÄúYou guys have class.‚Äù I thought at minimum the Pinstripe tradition would be acknowledged and the sentiment of class returned. At most, I thought it might bait an Astros bash. Nope. She didn‚Äôt even hesitate and said, ‚ÄúYou guys don‚Äôt.‚Äù

I was dumbfounded. I had a confused look on my face, probably slightly hurt-looking. I just walked away and have been writing this post.

2018 was supposed to be our year.  2017 was magical, and then we added reigning NL MVP, Giancarlo Stanton.  Everything was lining up.  Then the Red Sox cucked us so hard.  Even worse, they did it with Alex Cora at the helm, the bench coach of the team that snuffed out the magical playoff run in 2017.

He was so cocky and smug, in sharp relief of Boone, who has always been reserved and conscientious.  The only thing worse then a cocky piece of shit, is when they actually deliver the goods, which is why 2018 was one of the most painful seasons to be a Yankee fan in recent memory.

All that made it so gratifying when we pounded them over and over again this past season.  Having to watch Cora squirm and eat humble pie while talking to the press during the Sox' disastrous 2019 start was definitely a highlight of 2019.

The fact is, if Cora was more sympathetic, it wouldn't have felt so damn good to beat up on the Red Sox and watch them totally give up after the trade deadline.

Now for my extremely unpopular opinion: If Cora avoided suspension, kept his job and faced 0 consequences like the players, he would have ascended to levels of villainy for the Yankees the likes of which we've never seen.  It would have been straight mustache twirling territory.

We only face the Astros a few times a season, so our opportunity for cheater payback is limited.  With Cora still around, we'd have 19 games a year to feel that drama.

Can you imagine how amazing it would feel to tear up the Sox again this year and watch Cora seething in the dugout, knowing everything we know now?

But beyond that, I want to really want to root for a team. I have been to Rockies games and rooted for them over the Diamondbacks, but I really have no stake in who wins that game. It also is difficult to catch a Yankee game at each stadium, even with expanded interleague play. But I came up with another idea. I can really root for the home team if they are playing the Red Sox or Astros. So here is a list of games where you can root for a team and really mean it this year.

Dodger Stadium | Dodgers | None, but you could probably get a good Fuck the Astros chant going
Fenway Park | Red Sox | May22-24 (Astros, if you really want to root for the Red Sox), Jun12-14 (Yankees), Jul30-Aug2 (Yankees), Aug31-Sep2 (Yankees), All Season (Fuck the Red Sox)
Globe Life Stadium | Rangers | Apr10-12 (Astros), Apr13-15 (Yankees), May14-17 (Red Sox), Jul20-23 (Astros), Sep11-13 (Astros)

1582080231,Astros Punishment,"Every baseball fan across the sport (other than a select few Houston fans) knows that the Astros' punishment was merely a slap on the wrist and a little finger wag from the commissioner and the MLB saying ""Stop it."" It didn't punish a single player who participated in the cheating other than Carlos Beltran, Alex Corra, and AJ Hinch who got suspended for a year without pay by the MLB and all 3 fired by their teams. Clearly we need to punish the players who chose to use the banging of the trashcan to boost their 2017 stats including Altuve who (as a Yankee fan) stole the 2017 MVP from Judge which would have capped off his record-breaking Rookie season. That being said:

The first step is to straight-up ban Carlos Beltran from the MLB as he is basically the mastermind behind this. AJ Hinch should be suspended for 5 years instead of 1 year because as the manager he could have stopped all of this but chose not to. We still don't really know how big of a suspension (or possible ban) Alex Corra deserves as the Red Sox are still being investigated by the MLB for whatever the hell went on in 2018.

The second step is to suspend players for cheating.

Based completely on [the report made by an Astros fan](http://signstealingscandal.com/) that logged the bangs for each home game, I suggest that each Astros player should be suspended 1 game for every counted bang during the 2017 season while they were at-bat.

So:

* Carlos Correa would be suspended 97 games
* Josh Reddick would be suspended 28 games
* Jose Altuve would be suspended 24 games
* Alex Bregman would be suspended 133 games
* Yuli Gurriel would be suspended 120 games
* Jake Marisnik would be suspended 83 games

And so on.

I also think there should be a fine of $1,000 for every at-bat with banging that resulted in a home run and an additional $250 for every RBI. Grand Slam would result in $1,750 fine (only counting men on base) 3 Run Homer would result in $1,500 fine, 2 Run Homer would result in $1,250 fine, Solo Shot would result in $1,000 fine. The fine of the $250 per RBI would also be counted if the batter hit a single, double, or triple that drove in runs.

By doing this it would: A) Punish every player involved for cheating

B) Give all the teams who we know want revenge time to cool off and get back in the swing of things

C) Prevent the Astros Players from getting pelted every single game (even though I would like to see that happen.

What I can‚Äôt understand is like half of Astros fans who justify the cheating, go to Yankees and Dodgers Twitter and just post post things saying how they are the 17‚Äô world champs and just say ‚Äúweep‚Äù or things like that. They have absolutely no morals, they just care about having the title of world champion. They don‚Äôt care how they got it and want to argue with anything who calls anything into question. I actually feel bad for the other half of Astros fans that are very upset about the whole situation and don‚Äôt support what they did at all, and now their entire fan base is looking bad because of the other half. Yeah there‚Äôs gonna be bad fans of all teams like in the ALCS when the fans were harassing that Astros fan in the bathroom. That is absolutely not okay and I think all of you would agree with that. These Astros fans are just making the entire fan base look horrible. 

I‚Äôm really starting to hate the Astros and their fans more than the Red Sox. That is a rivalry etched in tradition and it‚Äôs more about hating each other because of that tradition. While with the Astros they are just complete immoral scumbags and their fans are just defending their every action. The whole situation would be much better if the Astros fans just admitted that the Astros cheated and that it was the wrong thing today. Same goes for the Astros themselves. If they just admitted that they were wrong in a SINCERE apology and admitted that it helped them win and were completely honest, people would be more likely to forgive them and move on.

The 2009 New York Yankees beat a really good Phillies team and won it all for the first time since 2000. It was also the first time the Yankees won the World Series at home since 1999 and the first year the Yankees won the World Series in a season when they had the best season record in baseball since 1998.

The 2009 World Series win is the ONLY World Series win I can TRULY say I experienced and got to enjoy as a Yankees fan. But putting aside my Yankee fandom, I seriously think the 2009 World Series is underrated by not just older Yankees fans, but a lot of baseball fans in general, especially on r/baseball.

It helps that we completely got rid of our Angels demons in the playoffs and got rid of some of our Red Sox demons for awhile by beating Boston four games in a row at the end of the season to win the division.

I can‚Äôt tell you how happy I was to see guys like Alex Rodriguez, Johnny Damon, Hideki Matsui, Robinson Cano, CC Sabathia, Nick Swisher, A.J. Burnett and Mark Teixira win a ring with the Yankees. And of course, seeing Jeter and other Yankees legends like Rivera, Pettitte and Posada getting it done together one more time was great as well.

Yet it sucked that the Moose and the Great Giambino weren't on that's year team, but I've long learned  since then that not every great player who plays with Yankees will even get the experience the great joy of winning the World Series with the Yankees.",self.NYYankees,f5wn8y,4,False,NYYankees

1582039961,Why are yankees fans going easy on the Red Sox right now?,"I am coming to this subreddit as a Mets fan but I am not going to be hating on the yankees.  I just wanted to be upfront about my allegiance.

Now obviously the Astros are a terrible organization and deserve much more in terms of punishment and hated for how they disgraced the game of baseball.  I encourage and support how yankees fans are reacting towards them since their cheating extremely likely cost the Yankees two trips to the World Series.

However I must admit I am disappointed in the fandom.  It really seems like 2018 Red Sox are almost getting a free pass in terms of hatred.  If I asked any yankees fan last year which team they hated the most it would be the Red Sox.  For all the obvious reasons but mainly because they exist.  However with the scandals breaking out with Astros it seems like they got a reprieve from your base.  Now I know the Astros eliminated you twice but the red Sox did too after you got the wild card with over a hundred wins.  The red Sox who probably only won that many games due to cheating, most likely the same way as the Astros did and they were already a team you completely despised.

Look as a mets fan I know all about hating multiple teams.  Mets fans hate the Yankees, the nationals, the phillies, the dodgers, and so many more.  Yankees have had it easy with mainly just hating the Red Sox and looking down on everyone else.  You need to expand your hatred without hating anyone else less.  The Astros deserve to be tormented for their transgressions but you play the Red Sox so many times more, they did the same thing, and you have such a good hatred for them.  So please don‚Äôt let up on your hate for them.  They deserve it too.

Signed,
A concerned Mets fan.",self.NYYankees,f5thue,19,False,NYYankees

1582003002,The Actual Value of the Yankees 27 World Series Trophies - In ‚ÄúPieces of Metal‚Äù,"On the 16th of February MLB Commissioner, and  [one time labor lawyer for the owners during the 1994-1995 strike](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/09/sports/baseball-baseball-talks-may-resume.html), came out in defense of his punishment of the Astros cheating scandal. At no point in his rambling, incoherent response were he even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this world is now dumber for having listened to it. Obviously he‚Äôs been awarded no points, and may God have mercy on the Astros‚Äô medical staff. A key piece of his response was his decision to allow the Astros to keep their World Series trophy stating [‚ÄúThe idea of an asterisk or asking for a piece of metal back seems like a futile act.‚Äù](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28714873/mlb-commissioner-rob-manfred-defends-punishment-astros) The Yankees, of course, own the record for most championships with 27.

That‚Äôs a lot of metal. 

Which leads me to today. I first wanted to know how much ‚Äúmetal‚Äù those 27 trophies contained, and how much it was worth. According to Wikipedia the [COMMISSIONERS TROPHY](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner%27s_Trophy_(MLB)#Design) (How IRONic?) weighs approximately 30 pounds and is comprised of sterling silver. For the purpose of this analysis we‚Äôll say it weighs 30 pounds exactly. That means the collective weight of all 27 trophies is 810 pounds or sterling silver. According to [coinapps](http://coinapps.com/silver/pound/calculator/) that amount would be worth $210,971.25. 

That‚Äôs a lot metal if you took it in pennies. 

But what does that amount of money buy you in today‚Äôs metal purchasing world? I did the work so you don‚Äôt have to. Below is a small list of metal items that can be purchased with the accumulated value of all 27 trophies. 

It could buy you 8,449 [Trash Cans](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Behrens-31-Gal-Galvanized-Steel-Round-Trash-Can-with-Lid-1270/100202118) from Home Depot. 

It would also buy you 14,074 [aluminum bats](https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/p/franklin-venom-t-ball-bat-2018-11-17frayvnm110011tbkbt/17frayvnm110011tbkbt) from Dicks. Please note I used the Tee-ball bat not just for maximum purchasing power, but also because some second basemen need kid sized bats. 

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/202666/beer-prices-in-major-league-baseball-by-team/) you could purchase 35,162 beers at Yankee Stadium. Please note I could not find canned beer prices, so I assume this are the draft prices. 

For those who have trouble reading, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L9SH1KT/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_ue3sEbPMZ5HJ6) can hook you up with 19,227 3 packs of reading glasses. That‚Äôs a total of 57,800 individual pairs of glasses. 

As you can see, the accumulated wealth of the Yankees World Series Trophies alone can net you quite a few bright, shiny objects. Perhaps one day we‚Äôll have a commissioner who cares about the sport and it‚Äôs future. But until then, fuck the Red Sox. And fuck the Astros.

His tattoo is incredibly basic and easy. There's no reason a simple word should take more than one session lasting 3-5 hours, depending on how good the artist is. And let's be honest, if you're a millionaire athlete you're definitely not going to a shitty artist. I doubt the tattoo looked ""bad.""

No one really covers up unfinished tattoos. I have one or two pieces I haven't had finished yet, but I make no effort to cover them up. 

If I hit the walk-off to send my team to the World Series, I'm not worried about showing my unfinished tattoo.

Some notable storylines heading in, in no particular order:

**The Rightful 2017 MVP Reports to Camp**

Many people have been angered by the Trashtros cheating scandal and it's aftermath, and have made their disdain known in the last few days, but one who has remained mostly silent is our favorite right fielder, Aaron Judge,one of the position players effected most by the scheme, finishing his historic 2017 rookie season in second place of MVP voting to Jose Altuve, and one of the only players who was in both the '17 and '19 ALCS starting lineup. [He has already somewhat made a statement on social media,](https://twitter.com/YankeeBible/status/1216827119977693184) but he will almost certainly be asked to give his first public comments on the scandal. In his brief time in the spotlight, Judge has been careful not to give headline quotes, but could this be the occasion that breaks from the norm?

It will be must watch TV, for sure. But on to actual baseball...

**The Giancarlo Stanton Redemption Tour Begins**

There's really no way around it, Giancarlo Stanton had a **bad** 2019. Only playing in 22 games across the regular and post-season, he was one of the biggest victims of The Great IL Plague of 2019, being robbed of a full season with the juiced ball. It certainly didn't help his, let's call it the *divisive* opinion of him among Yankee fans since the surprise trade for him in 2018. But the fact remains that when healthy, he is a force to be reckoned with, and this is hopefully the year Stanton finally shows what he is fully capable of.

**Andujar Gets Flexible**

After Gio Urshela earned his way to the starting 3B job last season, Miguel Andujar will have the Spring to show that:

1.  He has fully recovered from last year's season-ending labrum tear, so he can get time at DH, and


2. That he can play multiple positions like 1B and LF even decently,

Because even though his defense leaves a lot to be desired, when healthy, his bat simply cannot be left out of the lineup.

There are other headlines to be sure, such as finding out if the breakout stars of the #NextManUp movement (Tauchman, Ford, and even Urshela), can repeat last year's success at the plate, and the battle for bench spots, but IMO, it all really comes down to:

**Keeping the Band Together**

I don't have to tell you that the 2019 Yankees were ravaged by injuries to nearly all of their major stars until the end, and even despite winning 103 games, and taking a cheating team to 6 games in the ALCS, the 2020 version **cannot** afford the same IL stints to happen again. So [GM Brian Cashman completely overhauled the Strength and Conditioning department in the off-season,](https://twitter.com/Yankees/status/1217126300122537984) headlined by new director of player health and development Eric Cressey, who might be the most important Yankee who won't play a game this year. We know that the only thing that can stop this juggernaut of a squad is injuries, and the new S+C will hopefully work as hard as possible to stomp the injury bug out.

1581915610,2/17/20 ODT: Rob Manfred likes frisbees Edition,"[The commissioner of baseball Rob Manfred](https://i.redd.it/oj63exs1mdh41.jpg) held a press conference Sunday to cement his legacy as a bottom tier commissioner.

[He considered](https://twitter.com/Chandler_Rome/status/1229163013892169729) vacating the 2017 title, but probably not seriously. 

He warns pitchers there will be [serious consequences](https://twitter.com/lindseyadler/status/1229164471064633344) to intentionally hitting batters, resulting in more punishment than what the Astros players received for cheating. 

He made an [ill-advised sarcastic comment](https://twitter.com/lindseyadler/status/1229165783764414464) to Jared Diamond, the guy who broke the Codebreaker scheme. 

[He thinks](https://twitter.com/BillPlaschke/status/1229151657893580800) the trophy is just a piece of metal. Not even Selig said something as idiotic as that.

And Manfred believes the Astros [did not escape punishment](https://twitter.com/Chandler_Rome/status/1229160703799562240) and public embarrassment is enough of a punishment. Lol. Just lol. 

Rob Manfred is a clown who likes frisbees and is merely a shill to the MLB owners. The only thing Manfred has going for him over Selig now is Congress hasn't gotten involved, yet.

Baseball-Reference [recalculates](https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2019/03/2019-war-update/) a player's WAR in recent seasons so that park factor adjustments are computed from three year rolling averages centered at the season in question. For example, a player's 2017 park adjustment on Baseball-Reference is now computed using data from the 2016-2018 seasons. Fangraphs also does similar annual recalculations, but their park adjustments use data from [a 5 year period.](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/pitcher-win-values-explained-part-six/) This means that, unlike RBI totals or slugging percentage, WAR and other stats like OPS+ and wRC+ that incorporate park factors are not finalized until several years after the season ends. Even after that, WAR may be changed because of the addition of new data, or alterations to the formula.

Sometimes, the recalculations will not change a player's WAR total that much, if at all. On Baseball-Reference, Aaron Judge's WAR was listed at 8.08 (7.20 oWAR, 0.31 dWAR) at the end of 2017, 8.09 (7.20 oWAR, 0.32 dWAR) after 2018's recalculations, and 8.08 (7.19 oWAR, 0.32 dWAR) after 2019's recalculations. When players compete at ballparks that have become more or less friendly to hitters or pitchers, their WAR may be inflated or deflated by [up to half a win](https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2012/10/why-can-war-change-from-one-year-to-next/) accordingly, until corrections that reflect these changes are made a few years later. This uncertainty is one of the reasons that WAR isn't supposed to be differentiate between players that are within one win of each other.

It just so happens that that in 2017, the BBWAA voted for a player on a team with the most inflated park factors in baseball. The Astros' position players lost a total of 2.76 rWAR. Altuve lost 0.26 rWAR, going from 8.32 rWAR (8.05 oWAR, 0.74 dWAR) to 8.06 rWAR (7.78 oWAR, 0.74 dWAR). The only position player to lose more WAR was Josh Reddick. On Fangraphs, which uses a longer period for calculating park factors (5 years instead of 3), Judge kept his ~0.7 fWAR lead over Altuve‚Äîboth gained about 0.1 fWAR. I'm limiting this discussion to position players because Baseball-Reference changed their formula for pitching WAR to accomodate openers at the same time as they published 2019's recalculations. This sort of thing has happened before ‚Äî in 2015, MVP Josh Donaldson appeared to finish with 8.81 rWAR, while WAR Lord Mike Trout's had 9.39 rWAR. Again, Baseball-Reference's later recalculations determined that Donaldson and the Blue Jays hitters had the most inflated park factors in baseball that year. The Blue Jays position players lost a total of 2.80 rWAR; Donaldson's new total for 2015 is 8.54 rWAR, and Trout's new total for 2015 is 9.35 rWAR. 

The park factor changes are listed [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tlzWDhLY4ZHd1NZexuTmmsZkLsguWHpFgm3vytEX-GY/edit?usp=sharing) You can see that Globe Life Park in Arlington and Minute Maid park were more friendly to hitters than previously calculated. This is why Astros and Rangers position players lost the most rWAR‚Äîsee the table below. In particular, MMP's 2018 park factor was much friendlier to line drives and fly balls hit to the left fielder. The removal of Tal's Hill may also have been a factor. [Sports-Reference posted about their 2018 update](https://np.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/84nkf4/baseballreference_2018_war_update_and_explanation/) about their annual WAR update, but did not do so for their 2019 update. Historical rWAR data is available [here](https://www.baseball-reference.com/data/), and here is my [list of rWAR changes for 2017's batters.] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wvWocIAfJYSKPfC7kvFp1gVGh8pHHyAwF-65XJpbTIc/)

I‚Äôve been on the edge of my seat rooting for these teams over the last three years, and it pains me to think that our 2 longest playoff runs in the last 6 years may been brought to an end illegitimately (as much as we Fuck the Red Sox, I don‚Äôt believe that they used their cheating method in the 2018 ALDS).  

There is a real chance that if the Astros had never cheated, we could‚Äôve experienced the electric 2017 Yankees team, with lovable leaders like Todd Frazier, Didi Gregorius, and CC Sabathia, play in the World Series.  Now we never will, and the fact that cheating might have been the reason for that makes me sick.

*  If Altuve's wife truly was a deciding factor in him not taking his jersey off, then why haven't we heard from her or have seen her make a public comment?

 All it would take (sort of) would be for her publically say, ""I hate when my boyfriend takes his shirt off and I am telling the world now that was on me and I take responsibilty""

* Robert Manford is conspiristically (?) employed by the owners and may be an employed scaredy-cat. It's incredibly possible he appeased to Jim Crane, an owner, to squash any possible expansive implications.

* The reason nobody on the team legitimately showed a true apology (although I watched Correa and respected that interview) is that they are trying to protect their Las Vegas-like ""what stays in the clubhouse, stays in the clubhouse"" mentality""
* I've cheated before on something. We all have. The odds they stopped on their own is slim. They very plausibly cheated up until this scandle - unless they had their own internal group-meeting.
* Bregman's apology was the most trollish, insincere shit I've ever seen on television. Even Crosby looked like he took it serious. Bregman almost couldn't hold back laughing.

* Jim crane is an idiot in 100 different ways. The fact he is not willing to admit it impacted the game (he did, but retracted it) makes you think he doesn't care about the cheating either.",self.NYYankees,f4o443,3,False,NYYankees

But how are we going to shit on Verlander for being disingenuous, celebrate Fiers for his honesty, and than act like Cole is completely innocent? These guys were all on the same staff! All three of those things can‚Äôt possibly be true at the same time.

He said in his interview that he had no idea that it was going on, and personally, I simply can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs true. Anyone who has played baseball knows how tight clubhouses are, and while there is a definite distinction between pitchers/position players, these guys are together literally every day for 6-8 months at a time. It‚Äôs a wild leap of the imagination to say with 100% confidence that of all the players on that roster, Gerrit Cole is the one who honestly didn‚Äôt know and is completely innocent.

The argument can me made that he didn‚Äôt benefit personally from the hitters cheating, but that‚Äôs crazy! The man has a World Series ring! I know damn well he would never do it, but it‚Äôd make me feel a hell of a lot better cheering for him if he just came out and said ‚Äúyeah, we cheated, we all knew about it, and I‚Äôm pissed off that my accomplishments as a pitcher are going to be questioned/forever tainted because of the actions of the hitters.‚Äù 

I feel like there‚Äôs a big gray area that Yankees fans are going to fall into about this. If he had re-signed with the Astros instead of with us, I would fucking hate this guy.

1581656433,Off Day Thread 2/14/20: I ‚ô•Ô∏è The Yankees Edition,"Happy Valentine's Day to all the fans of the 27-Time World Champion New York Yankees.

Here's the latest:
Yesterday, the Asterisks held their first official press conference addressing the sign-stealing scandal.

Let's just say, [it didn't go well.](https://i.imgur.com/cqpb16l.png) Once again, shout-out to Marly Rivera, Lindsay Adler, and Stephanie Apstein for pushing the questioning.

Meanwhile, back in Tampa, Gerrit Cole
[gave his first presser of the Spring.](https://youtu.be/Pt0R5jmQ3rE) A lot of interesting stuff there.

Speaking of Cole, MLB Network has finished their ranking of the Top 100 Players Right Now.

The Yankees on the List:

Severino - 83

Sanchez - 80

Chapman- 75

Stanton - 63

Lemahieu - 37

Gleyber - 31

Judge - 16

Cole - 7 (Highest ranked pitcher on the list)

In the words of a great manager, It's What You Want.

Last night, The Isles get shut out by Nashville, 5-0, the Devils beat Detroit 4-1, and the Rangers pull off the comeback against the Wild 4-3 in a shootout.

Tonight, the Rangers head to Columbus to face the Blue Jackets, the Devils take on the Hurricanes, and NBA All-Star Weekend kicks off from Chi-Town with the ""Celebrity"" Game at 7 on ESPN, and then TNT takes over the festivities with the Rising Stars Game @ 9PM.

I know there's been a lot of anger at baseball related news the past few days, and rightfully so, but in honor of Valentine's Day, what do you love most about the greatest franchise in sports?

1581642198,Reasons to dislike some Astros players (besides benefiting from trashcan banging),"Obviously I could just say banging, but there are other reasons to dislike these unlikable cheaters. Some will have things to do with the whole cheating scandal but won't be exactly them just benefitting from it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Justin Verlander: Was very vocal about topics such as cheating and players who have committed domestic abuse, but since Osuna has joined the Astros, he has been awfully silent.  And for someone who was so vocal against cheating you would think he would have stepped up in stopping the Astros cheating. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yuli Gurriel: Mr. Gurriel made a racist gesture against Dodger's pitcher, Yu Darvish in the 2017 World Series and was punished by getting a 5 game suspension the following season. 

&amp;#x200B;

Alex Bregman: Bregman just exudes so much smugness to the point where he just seems like a dbag. It was hilarious when Juan Soto hit the homerun in the WS and carried his bat to first mocking Bregman. He also had a super fake apology today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jose Altuve: In addition to the other fake apology today, he cheated Judge out of an MVP (that Judge should have won anyway). 

&amp;#x200B;

Josh Reddick: In addition to acting like a baby, just today he said there was no need to apologize and acted all smug about it. At least Carlos Correa had some decency to admit that what they did was wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lance McCullers Jr.: Once again, another Astros player who has acted all smug about the cheating. He even went as far to get into a fight with Trevor Bauer on Twitter. He was just bragging about cheating. 

&amp;#x200B;

Roberto Osuna: I saved the absolute worst for last. This complete and utter scumbag is a domestic abuser. This is bigger than baseball, this guy isn't like the others where they are bad for wanting to win by any means necessary, he is just a horrible person.",self.NYYankees,f3k9yy,13,False,NYYankees

I'll be damned if I let it go to waste though, so here goes:

Today is the day.

For the 24th time, Pitchers and Catchers will begin to report to George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida for New York Yankees Spring Training. It's time to talk baseball again, boys and girls. As if we ever fucking stopped.

Some notable storylines heading in:

**What are Blake's Takes?**

This is Matt Blake's first season as Yankees pitching coach, and although the move was lauded by those in the know, I still think it will be interesting to see how he handles the development of the young talent early on, and hopefully we get some more insight into his philosophy as the Spring rolls on.

**Battle of the Backups**

Josh Thole, Erik Kratz, Chris Ianetta, and incumbent Kyle Higashioka will spend camp trying to become the Yankee we hopefully see the least this year, backup catcher. 

**Fight for The 5 Spot**

With James Paxton on the shelf for the first few weeks of the season, it will be Jordan Montgomery, Deivi Garcia, Michael King, Jonathan Loaisiga, and Luis Cessa battling it out for the last spot in the rotation. Gumby will have the advantage as the most proven, but with him over a year removed from TJS, is there room for a surprise to emerge?

And finally...

**The Cole (Hype) Train Pulls into Tampa**

 All eyes will be on The 324 Million Dollar Man, Gerrit Cole, as we see his first pitches with the Yankees, and all the hype (and questions) that will come with them. Will he continue to make a good impression, on and off the field? Probably.

What are you looking forward to in this first phase of ST?

1581471530,Interesting Fact About Gerrit Cole...,"My wife and I were running numbers last night for the hell of it, and we discovered something interesting about Gerrit Cole's strikeout percentage(K%). Obviously the guy is a stud, but he's even more scary to batters than we had previously thought.

What month of the 2019 regular season would you say Cole was most dominant? Probably April or May, right? No. The answer is September.

Here's the data for you guys:

League Average K% is 20%

Above Average  K% is  22%

Gerrit Cole lifetime is at 27.5%

Last Season he was at a whopping 39.9%

In September of 2019, Cole had 6 starts.

14 K's against Milwaukee

15 K's against Seattle

11 K's against Kansas City

10 K's against Texas

14 K's against Seattle

10 K's against LA Angels

In that stretch he faced 152 batters and had a total of 72 K's giving him a K% of 48.6%

IN SEPTEMBER HE STRUCK OUT ALMOST HALF OF ALL THE BATTERS HE FACED, IN FREAKING SEPTEMBER!!!

He had a career high 212.1 innings pitched in 2019, and DOMINATED(not amazing teams, but still...) the month of September.

Sorry for the lengthy post, and probably crap formatting as I'm typing this on mobile, but we REALLY wanted to share this with you guys.

Manfred Jr. Throughout his term as commissioner, Manfred has continuously proved himself unfit to serve in his role. He has committed high crimes and misdemeanors against the sport, which shall be outlined in the following document. Two articles will be drafted.

**ARTICLE 1: ABUSE OF BASEBALL**

Throughout his tenure as Commissioner of Major League Baseball, Mr. Manfred has continuously abused the game of baseball so many have grown to appreciate. Mr. Manfred has instituted multiple new rules designed to ‚Äúspeed up‚Äù the game. These rules are nearly universally hated by the greater baseball community.

EXAMPLE ONE: LIMITATIONS ON MOUND VISITS. Mound visits are an essential part of the game of baseball. If a pitcher is struggling, a quick break from action may help calm his nerves and allow him to refocus on his task - getting batters out. 

EXAMPLE TWO: THREE BATTER MINIMUM. Gone are the days of lefty specialists or clutch relievers. With Mr. Manfred‚Äôs new policy, pitchers will be required to pitch to three batters regardless of how poor they perform. This will lead to a lower morale among bullpen pitchers.

EXAMPLE THREE: LIMITING SEPTEMBER CALL-UPS. Mr. Manfred has limited teams from expanding their September rosters to 40 players. Instead, teams can now expand to just 28. No longer can teams see how prospects perform at a major league level, and no longer can teams rest their star players in the final days of the season.

**ARTICLE TWO: OBSTRUCTION OF INVESTIGATIONS**

During November of 2019, Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich, reporters for The Athletic, broke a story about the Houston Astros using technology to steal opposing team‚Äôs signs. The story dominated baseball and mainstream news, overshadowing free agent signings. Mr. Manfred punished the Astros organization after an investigation, which confirmed the use of a high speed camera, monitor with live feed, and trash can at home games during the 2017 regular and postseason.

However, more information has come out detailing the Astros ‚Äúdark arts‚Äù operations, including use on the road during the 2017 season, and it‚Äôs expansion into the 2018 season. Mr. Manfred attempted to sweep this information ‚Äúunder the rug‚Äù so that baseball commentators and fans would stop talking about the scandal, but he has in turn only made it worse.

We here at r/NYYankees put forth these articles to the baseball community as a vote of no confidence to Commissioner Manfred‚Äôs corrupt and damaging nature, and request his immediate removal from office.",self.NYYankees,f2ftwc,19,False,NYYankees

Today the XFL 2.0 ends it's inaugural weekend with another doubleheader, including the New York Guardians making their debut at MetLife against the Tampa Bay Vipers, the Knicks play the Hawks in a Sunday Matinee, and the Rangers host the Kings.

And there's also some big movie awards show tonight. So that sounds fun.

Boston wasn‚Äôt going to be very competitive this year anyway, and trading 1 year of Betts for 4-5 years of Verdugo + a talented pitching prospect seems like a good return for the Sox.

What I‚Äôm worried about is the Dodgers. It looks like the odds are on a NYY-LAD World Series, and Betts going to LA just makes our job harder. 

I can envision a nightmare scenario where the Dodgers win the WS, Sox get under the luxury tax, and one of the two teams re-signs Betts.

Of course, the fact that Betts is out of the AL East basically cuts the Sox threat to almost zero, and there‚Äôs less direct competition. I‚Äôm just saying, I would have much preferred Betts to the Padres or almost any other team.",self.NYYankees,f0z3xu,18,False,NYYankees

1581188835,Why Altuve winning 2017 MVP bothers me more than Astros winning 2017 ALCS,"I know this might be some backwards thinking that not everyone may agree with. 


But I felt like we played our asses off, nearly good enough to win the series. I can‚Äôt say with extreme confidence which plays were affected. I do think the Yankees would have won, but there‚Äôs no way to know how the games might have played out differently. But the Yankees at least had an opportunity to go out there and beat the Astros in spite of everything going on. You don‚Äôt grant someone as a winner just because they lost to someone how cheated. 


HOWEVER, my feelings change in regards to an award like MVP. MVP recognizes a great season, and is driven by personal stats and team success. I can say with extreme confidence that Altuve‚Äôs stats would not have been as good. He‚Äôs a great hitter, but the runs and RBIs would have certainly been lower. 

Altuve 2017: .348 avg, 24 HR, 81 RBI, 112 runs 
Judge 2017: .284 avg, 52 HR, 114 RBI, 128 runs

And then think about Judge‚Äôs 2017 season. In August alone he batted .175 with 3 HR and 7 RBIs. While we don‚Äôt know the exact impact of cheating, we all know judge struck out a LOT that season, and especially during that stretch after the all star game. Imagine if during that slump he was given the pitch  a few times a game, I doubt the slump would have been as extreme.


So my main point is that during the ALCS, the yanks had a chance to directly overcome their cheating. Just like Dodgers players have been saying, they shouldn‚Äôt be awarded as winners just because the Astros cheated. You have to win on the field to bring home the trophy. 


But an award that recognizes an outstanding season? Judge absolutely deserves that. Altuve was recognized for stats that he didn‚Äôt earn, and Judge deserves it.",self.NYYankees,f0w24a,7,False,NYYankees

At best, he apologized for his involvement in the scandal, which unfortunately is more than you can say for the rest, but at worst, kept asserting he tried to stop it but apparently wasn't enough of a leader back then?,and gave a vague non-answer as to whether the Asterisks used buzzers in 2019.

What was *not* expected, however, was a [bombshell report from WSJ (paywalled)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/houston-astros-cheating-scheme-dark-arts-codebreaker-11581112994?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) confirming the following:

1. That it was indeed Houston's FO that spear-headed the sign-stealing project, titled ""Codebreaker"",

2. That Houston was using this system both at home *and* on the road, and most importantly,

3.  Rob Manfred massively bungled the punishment.

So yeah, there's that. On a lighter note, last night both NY basketball teams were off, and the Rangers late comeback fell short  as they lose to Buffalo, 3-2.

Today may be one of the better sports days of the year, as the XFL 2.0 kicks off with a two-network double-header at 2PM, CBB all day, headlined by Duke vs UNC @ 6PM, UFC 247, and NBA Saturday Primetime with the Lakers vs... the Curry-less Warriors at 8:30.

Yeah, the NBA took a big L with scheduling this year.

We have Stanton and Cole locked up for the next decade at about $60 million a year. Judge has a ROTY and (what should be) an MVP under his belt. This year was his first in arbitration and I believe Torres will qualify as well next off-season. My question is, do you guys think we can retain both Judge and Torres while being weighted down by Stanton. I personally despise the Stanton trade as he is a more fragile and unlikeable version of Judge. If we do retain Torres and Judge what do you think the contracts will look like? I like to see home grown talent stay with the same team and I don't understand the willingness to ""save money"" on the red Sox part given they are the second most wealthy team in the sport. I guess my worry is that we get stuck with Stanton and Torres while trading/losing Judge to free agency.",self.NYYankees,f0jrc2,9,False,NYYankees

Not a lot of things would ever make me sympathize with Red Sox fans but this one is doing just that. There are guys on every team that are supposed to be untouchable. Mookie Betts and Andrew Benintendi seemed to be those guys for Boston. For John Henry to masquerade as this pauper who has to cut salary to survive is utter bullshit.

1580888153,Angel fan helping Yankee fans who are making their way to Angels home Opener April 3rd against the Houston Astros ( I also Posted in Dodgers subreddit as well and didn't forget about you guys who also suffered a great loss to the Astros),"I outlined just a few things to hopefully help you guys out if you are making your way to the Angels Home Opener to Boo the Astros. There are 3 major entrances to Angel Stadium which I have shown with the grey arrows. They are the Entrance from Katella Ave and Douglass Rd on the north East part of the stadium which will lead you to the Gates toward the outfield. An entrance on Orangewood Ave which leads you to the home plate/first base side/right field of the stadium. And another entrance from Gene Autry Way that will lead you to Home plate/third base side/left field. The Gene Autry Entrance is a little tricky as when you enter there is a split path that will take you to the designated way as explained above but if you go to the right side of the entrance it will lead you towards home plate/first base side. I will try to explain this as best as I can, if coming from Gene Autry way and at the stop light there are 2 left turn lanes, two straight lanes and on right turn only lane. The Right left turn lane allows you to turn to the left side of the entrance towards the 3rd base side (at least that is what most people do). The two straight lanes allow you to take the right and/or left side, so BE CAREFUL! Police will be directing traffic but it can get very pushy form other drivers.

One big thing too, there is currently construction on State College BLVD and Orangewood Ave, hopefully (but doubtful) it will be done before the season starts. State College is down to two lanes from three and Orangewood is sometimes down to one or two from three.

There will be multiple places you can park in and around the stadium, trust me you will see them.

There are a few breweries around the area as well: Golden Road and Karl Strauss Brewing on Orangewood, JT Schmid's Restaurant and Brewery on Katella and Douglass, and Backstreet Brewery Near Gene Autry off on a side street. I do not drink so please don't ask me which one is best.

Finally there is a good assortment of Fast food on State College and Katella as well as a Denny's. All within decent walking distance to the stadium including the breweries.

I hope this helps anyone of you guys who are planning on making your way to the Angels home opener. Our teams and our fans may not always get along but we definitely agree on one thing:

FUCK THE ASTROS!!

The desktop is easier to view and gives you better looking charts but in case you‚Äôre on a phone you should definitely use the mobile version. 

Link to mobile version: [Mobile Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/clayton.lukes#!/vizhome/MajorLeagueBaseballAttendancePayrollandTeamPerformanceStatistics1985-2019-MobileVersion/Story2)

Link to desktop version: [Desktop Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/clayton.lukes#!/vizhome/MajorLeagueBaseballAttendancePayrollandTeamPerformanceStatistics1985-2019-DesktopVersion/Story1)

I compiled the attendance, payroll, and team performance stats of every team in the MLB from 1985-2019. 

I used the inflation rates from 2019 vs each year in the data to calculate a ‚ÄúPayroll in 2019 USD‚Äù. So the data you see for payroll has been adjusted for inflation and they are all in 2019 USD. This makes the payroll data more meaningful, as the payrolls are now using the same ‚Äòyear‚Äô in terms of money value. 

To use the dashboards here are some tips: 

- You can filter by team and can select one team or multiple teams. It‚Äôs currently preset to just the Pirates. Changing this will update the charts for whichever team(s) you choose. 
- You can filter by year to change the timeframe you want to view. 
- The mobile version has 4 different tabs to move through. You have to select the next dot to move through the dashboard.

I am going to watch the Yankees play the Blue Jays in the first spring training game of the year on Feb 22. I see regular assigned seating (section 215) for about $68 all in, or ""3rd base club"" for about $81 all in. I have seen sports games from these types of ""premium"" decks with no reserved seating before and enjoyed it. The trick is that the 3rd base club also includes food and non-alcoholic drink. The way I see it, I was going to spend $15 on food in the regular seats anyway, so the price difference is basically a wash.

I've never been to this field so I am wondering if anyone has been in the 3rd base club and can recommend it, or not, over more traditional infield seating.

1580274537,Yankee fans should want Betts in Boston in 2020.,"I see a lot of Yankee fans getting excited over Betts leaving Boston, but I don't really get it since the worst thing that could happen to the Red Sox is Mookie sticking with them in 2020. The Red Sox not trading Betts keeps Boston far above the luxury tax, keeps them from getting any type of significant return that could help them in the future, and keeps him far away from the Dodgers. While the Red Sox might be an above .500 team with what they currently have, they aren't better than the Yankees, Rays, Athletics, or Astros. Rays are winning one of the wildcard spots and whoever finishes second in the AL West is winning the other spot. 

I think the issue is that Yankee fans really just want to see Boston suffer. So much so that we want them to suffer a little more now by not having Betts, even if it means them strengthening their future.  I'm rooting for the Red Sox to keep Betts and then lose him for a messily qualifying offer pick. I think that's something we should all agree on.",self.NYYankees,evi9aa,26,False,NYYankees

He also had a 2.97 ERA, 1.247 WHIP, and 6 CGSO, as well as finishing 2nd in MVP voting.

In the World Series, he blew up in Game 2, allowing 4 runs in .1 innings. In Game 5, facing elimination, he threw a CGSO. In Game 6, up 1 in the bottom of the 10th with runners on 1st and 3rd with 2 outs, he came in and secured the save. In Game 7, he came into the game in the 3rd inning to pitch the final 6.2 innings and secure the Yankees' 18th World Series victory.

1579970708,Inherited large collection and seeking advice,"First off, this is my first Reddit in a long time so I apologies if I'm breaking a rule here. I don't use reddit much...

I live in Asheville, NC and have come in possession of a large baseball card and signed baseball collection from a man who lived is entire life in New York City and died at the age of 80 in 2013. His widow is a friend of my mom's and she has asked me to help her sell the stuff but knowing nothing about baseball memorabilia, I am not about to part it out, nor send it all off to get it graded etc. I've taken it to a local pawn shop that had a few knowledgable workers and they were losing their minds over the collection. I also took it to a place in Sylva, NC called Sports Collectibles and he also thought that I could be sitting on a goldmine. There are hundreds of cards from the 50's to the 90's, signed balls from 50's (at least 2 that have paperwork) and bunch of 50's Bowman cards and honestly a bunch of other collectible stuff. 

I'm posting this here because this guy was a New Yorker so there is a lot of New York memorabilia. I will also post this in a few other reddits...

The sports collectible guy told me he wouldn't take any less than 8k for everything if it were to go to someone who is going to sell it. That said, the widow has agreed to take offers for it all but being that it is such a niche market, I honestly don't know how to find a buyer. I'm trying to avoid Ebay if at all possible. She really needs the money to help her pay for her living expenses as she recently went into a home...

This could be a big moneymaker for a buyer and worst case, a break-even situation. All the cards look to be in excellent condition and nicely organized. I've taken some photos, not of everything as there is too much...

1579885280,A Brief Look Back at Nick Johnson's Career,"Offseason boredom so I decided to look up obscure Yankees and came across Nick Johnson. He is the biggest what if I have found when doing my research. Some of you know him for his go ahead 2 run homer in the 2003 World Series (sorry if I am reopening old wounds):

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeszkoPLs7Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeszkoPLs7Y) 

He was selected in the 3rd by the Yankees in the 1996. Had a career slashline .268/.399/.411. What is neat about him is his eye on the plate. In 2003 in 406 PAs he had a 17.2% walk rate and 14.0% strikeout rate along with 143 wRC+ and a .393 wOBA. 

When he was traded to Montreal/DC in 2004 he best year came in 2006. In 628 PAs (his healthiest season) he had a 17.5% walk rate, a 15.8% strikeout rate, a 147 wRC+, and .404 wOBA. Homeboy, could flat out hit and get on base at an effective rate.  Sadly his career was mired with injuries and could have been (in my opinion) the Yankees first basemen for years if he was healthy. Averaged about 91 games per season from 2001-2008.

From 2010-2012 he played with the Yankees again, the Indians AA and AAA team, and finally the O's. Injuries kept him off the field for most of the time. It all came to a close when in June 27th, 2012 he suffered a wrist injury and was sidelined for the rest of the the season. He opted for retirement in January of next year due to long-lasting injuries he had in his career.

1579881875,Name a beloved Yankee (of your lifetime) you never liked.,"I‚Äôll get some hate for this, but my answer is easily CC Sabathia.

Being the big Mussina fan I am, I was always never going to warm up to the pitcher that replaced Moose no matter how good that pitcher was or whether or not they won a title with the next pitcher or not. Yes, I know it was Mussina‚Äôs choice to retire after 08, but I still wished he played for two more seasons and could have been apart of the 2009 championship.

But putting aside the fact that Sabathia replaced Mussina, I just never liked him as a player and his attitude always rubbed me the wrong way (and still does).  And I lost even a lot of more respect for him after the comments he made about President Trump.  While, he is free to believe what he wants and I know Trump‚Äôs presidency has a been a major mixed bag so far...I prefer if baseball players and all athletes in general kept their mouth shut about American politics shut in general and not bother saying anything positive or negative about the President if they don‚Äôt like them.

1579820208,Opening Day WFAN Broadcast," Suzyn: ‚Ä¶and as Hanser Alberto steps up to the plate, stepping up to the microphone is the voice of the New York Yankees, here is: John Sterling.

John: Well Suzyn, I thank you. And once again, good afternoon everyone. We are back for another season of Yankees baseball, and what a beautiful day here at Camden Yards in Baltimore‚Äôs Inner Harbor. First pitch, strike. Fastball on the inside corner from Cole, and we are underway.

S: Gerrit‚Äôs fastball at 97 miles per hour. Speed is important for pitchers, and it‚Äôs important for drivers too. Drive 25 in New York City, a reminder from the Vision Zero Initiative. 

J: The 0-1 pitch, Cole deals, grounded to short. Torres fields, fires, one away. The Yankees have high hopes for Torres playing shortstop full time, don‚Äôt they Suzyn?

S: That‚Äôs right Jawn. I spoke to Aaron Boone the other day, and he told me even though Gleyber hit .465 with 18 homers in spring training, they‚Äôre even more excited about the improvements he‚Äôs made on the defensive side.

J: The 0-2 pitch.. striiike 3. Swing and a miss on the breaking ball outside. And wow what a breaking ball that was from Cole! It looks like the Yankees got a good one here Suzyn!

S: Wow is right Jawn! Oh what a beautiful pitch! And that is the first strikeout of the game. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center is striking out cancer with the Cyberknife treatment. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. More science. Less fear.

J: And stepping into the batters‚Äô box with 2 outs is right fielder, Trey Mancini. And you know, there aren‚Äôt too many bright spots in this Orioles lineup (small chuckle), but Mancini is a pretty good ballplayer. First pitch, swung on and it‚Äôs a fly ball out to center field. Gardner is under it, makes the catch. And that‚Äôs 3 up 3 down for the Orioles in the top of the first. No runs, no hits, nobody left, and at the end of a half, it‚Äôs Baltimore nothing, and the New York Yankees coming to bat. 

(commercial break)

S: Yankees baseball on WFAN is brought to you by your local Ford dealer. Go to buyford.com for big savings today. Ford. Built Ford Tough. 

J: And on the mound for Baltimore is John Means. You know Suzyn, along with Trey Mancini, John Means is another one of the handful of players on this team that isn‚Äôt complete dog shit. 

S: You know Jawn, you‚Äôre right. And non-dogshit players are brought to you by Shiner. Whether you're on the couch or out on your back porch, just open up a cold Shiner Bock to go straight to the heart of Shiner country. Means is a kid with a nice little changeup, and he had pretty good numbers last year. He was only 12-11, but he had a 3.60 ERA. It‚Äôs just tough to-

J: Pitch.. outside, 1 and 0. And you‚Äôre right Suzyn. You know how I feel about all those numbers these days, but there‚Äôs only so much the guy can do. He‚Äôs pitching well, but they just can‚Äôt catch the ball for him. The 1-0 to Lemahieu.. lined to right field. Mancini plays it on a hop, throws to second, and that‚Äôs a leadoff single for DJ. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever mentioned this before Suzyn, but Lemahieu is such a great player. He can really do it all. 

S: I think you may have mentioned that once or twice before. That line drive was brought to you by Jeep. Visit your local Jeep dealership for their Spring Drive event to see their full line of- 

J: Swung on and DRILLED IN THE AIR TO DEEP CENTER FIELD. THAT BALL IS HIGH, IT IS FAR, IT IS over the center fielder‚Äôs head. He‚Äôll play it off the wall on a bounce and throw it in. Lemahieu will score easily and Judge is into second with a long double, and the Yankees will take a 1-nothing lead. That was almost a Stoli bomb, which would have been brought to you by Stoli Vodka. Ask your local bartender for his favorite flavor of Stoli. 

S: Well Jawn, I don't believe that's how that's supposed to go. That announcing mishap was our first Home Run False Alarm of the season, and that is brought to you by ADT Home Security. Unlike Jawn, ADT only gives you real alarms to protect you and your loved ones.

J: Swung on and it's flied to left. IT IS HIGH, IT IS FAR, IT IS GONE! A STANTONIAN BLAST! GIANCARLO. NO SI PUO STOPARLO!!! (Chuckle) So much for John Means not being dog shit, huh Suzyn?

S: How about that? Just as soon as we say something nice about the Orioles, they've given up 3 runs without recording an out, and all 3 balls were absolutely smoked.

J: Let me guess, next you're going to tell me we have an ad read for smoked balls?

S: As a matter of fact, that's exactly right Jawn. Those 3 balls were smoked off the bat, just like Arby's Smoked Turkey Sandwich. For a limited time at Arby's, you can get 2 sandwiches with fries and drinks for just 20 dollars. Arby's. We have the meats.

J: Well fuck me. So how about those Astros? That Bregman and Cora are a couple of real pieces of-

J: ...GONE! VOIT IS ADROIT!

J: Yeah, between those 2 and that hobbit fuck Altuve I don't-

S: That dirty lying hobbit Altuve is brought to you by the new Lord of the Rings series. That will be streaming on Amazon Prime or something, who gives a fuck. 

J: ...throw to first, in time to end the inning. But not before the Yankees take a 12-nothing lead. That's 12 runs on 10 hits, 3 errors, 2 left on base, and we'll go to the top of the 2nd on the WFAN New York Yankees radio network, driven by Jeep.

1579811593,Remaining Free Agents,"By my count there are at least 75 FAs still available today. Based on the depth and talent of this team most of them don't seem to be a glaring fit for any position on the roster (26 or 40 man). That said I went through the list and saw a few interesting names. I am curious if there is anyone still available that fans think the Yankees should target bring into camp or even add to the roster. 

I personally am going under the assumption that the 40 man roster likely won't change too much unless there is a trade. I think if the Yankees make anymore signings, they will be minor league / spring training invite type deals. So here we're some names that I thought would be interesting and fit that description. 

**Billy Hamilton** \- worst OPS in baseball last year...I know...but he plays CF defense at an elite level and if something were to happen to an OF during Spring Training he could be a decent 5th OF / defensive replacement / pinch runner off the bench for a period of time. Plus the Yankees were able to revitalize Aaron Hick's career. Hamilton is a former top prospect...maybe they can make his bat somewhat useful...unlikely but you never know.  

**Juan Lagares** \- Pretty much the same thing as Hamilton...can't hit, plays great defense, not nearly as much speed, add in the fact that he's been very injury prone. 

**Brad Miller** \- Utility infielder who can also play OF and was with the team for a bit last year. Some offensive pop and could compete with the younger guys to be a fit on the bench to start the year should someone get hurt. He also is a lefty bat. Downside is he's basically a carbon copy of what Tyler Wade can do with less speed. 

**Derek Dietrich** \- Similar to the above. Lefty bat...plays everywhere. Had a good start until about June...then fell off and had surgery in September. The Yankees have been connected to him lightly before when he played for the Marlins and was (probably) available for cheap at the deadline. 

**Robbie Erlin** \- Kind of just felt like including a Pitcher in this and he's as under the radar as it gets. Bad numbers last year but decent underlying stats suggesting he was pretty unlucky. I could see him being someone Matt Blake gets a hold of and turns around into a decent lefty reliever option. You can't tell me he'd definitely be worse than someone like Tyler Lyons who will be competing for one of the last bullpen spots.

1579752440,Some of my favorite Derek Jeter statsüêê,"Perhaps you think it‚Äôs no big deal that Derek Jeter had 11 seasons in his career in which he batted over .300 and finished with both double-digit homers and steals. But you want to guess how many other players in history have had 11 seasons like that? The correct answer, according to Lee Sinins' Complete Baseball Encyclopedia: zero. Willie Mays had seven. Hank Aaron had six. Barry Bonds had eight. Name whatever high-average, power-speed guy you‚Äôd like. Ken Griffey Jr.? Seven. Alex Rodriguez? Eight. Frank Robinson? Five. It‚Äôs a reminder that Jeter could beat you in multiple ways. And did.


.377 Oh, all right, all right, I know that batting average isn't one of those stats that impresses the cool kids anymore. So how about this one? It‚Äôs Derek Jeter's career on-base percentage. And if you're not sure what to make of it, I can help. Since World War II, three dozen men have played at least 1,500 games at shortstop. You know how many of them had a higher career OBP than Jeter? Not one. Cal Ripken Jr. finished with a .340 OBP. Ozzie Smith wound up at .337. Alan Trammell had a .352 OBP. Among the shortstops of Jeter's lifetime, only Barry Larkin was even close, at .371.


92 From July 21, 2006 to May 16, 2007, Derek Jeter played in 100 games. He got a hit in 92 of them. Now once upon a time, in the 19th century, Wee Willie Keeler hit 'em where they weren‚Äôt in 93 out of 100 games. But since 1900, according to streak historian Trent McCotter, you‚Äôll find only one other player who got a hit in 92 of 100. That was Ichiro Suzuki, in 2008 and '09. But it‚Äôs mind-warping to look at the list of guys who never did it. Ty Cobb. Rogers Hornsby. Honus Wagner. Tony Gwynn. Pete Rose. George Brett. But the shortstop for the New York Yankees, who never won a batting title or hit in more than 25 games in a row? He did. We mention it only because consistency was Jeter‚Äôs most important product.


1,013 Can‚Äôt figure out why I love this so much, but whatever. Derek Jeter will finish his career with more than 1,000 multihit games. More than Tony Gwynn or Wade Boggs. More than Willie Mays or Rogers Hornsby. In fact, just three other hitters in the entire live ball era finished their careers in the 1,000 Multihit Game Club: Pete Rose (1,225), Stan Musial (1,059) and Hank Aaron (1,046). Pretty fair top of the order.



2,673 Here‚Äôs another super-cool number. It‚Äôs the number of games Jeter has played at shortstop. And it's not only more games than Ernie Banks and Robin Yount played at short put together, but also the most games by any man in history who played one defensive position and never played anywhere else -- not even in the 19th inning, for one batter. Pete Rose played six positions. Ty Cobb played seven. Stan Musial played five (including pitcher). And Derek Jeter played one position. And only one. Now that‚Äôs how it ought to be done.

1579750035,My Derek Jeter story,"I've been a Yankees fan since my grandmother dressed me in pinstripes as an infant. I went to my first game when I was four with my father and grew up idolizing Lou Gehrig. Having Muscular Dystrophy, his ""Luckiest Man"" speech resonated with me since the first time I read it at age seven.

When I was 20, I did what any die-hard Yankees fan did: Get season tickets. It was a Saturday plan with seats in left field upper deck wheelchair section, right in the front. As the 2011 season went on, it was obvious Jeter was going to reach 3,000 hits.

He was two hits away on the morning of Friday, July 10. I was so bummed that I would most likely miss it in person by one game. Thankfully, the game that night got rained out. Unfortunately, the next day was forecasted to have record high temperatures, not good for my body because of my disability. When I woke up the next morning, my father asked me one thing: ""We going?"" Hell yeah we are.

We got to our seats at around 12:30 and it was already almost 100 degrees. I did everything I could to stay in what little shade the upper deck provided and took my place in section 334 right at first pitch.

When Jeter came up in the first inning and got a hit after working a multiple pitch at-bat, the stadium erupted. I couldn't believe he was one hit away and I was there, but the oppressive heat was starting to get to me. My father asked me if I wanted to leave and I seriously thought about it, but something compelled me to stay.

When Jeter walked to the batter's box in the second inning, the aura of Yankee Stadium buzzed. It felt like a playoff game in the late 90s. Just as before, he worked the count. Pitch after pitch after pitch was fouled off until...

*CRACK*

The second the ball left his bat I knew. Everybody knew.

I think it was when Jeter round first base when I broke down. I think it was one part witnessing history and one part developing heat stroke, but I completely broke down. I immediately thought of my father taking me to my first game and feeling so lucky that he was right next to me again for that special moment.

We left as soon as Jeter got back to the dugout. It was fucking hot that day.",self.NYYankees,esnf4k,6,False,NYYankees

1579646663,Spoke to a member of the Yankees front office today (for job interview). Here's some notable quotes (including some about the Astros):,"**on each team's propriety analytics**

Yankees have their own version of WAR. Each team's version varies frequently with fWAR and bWAR in what they would call a ""meaningful way."" There are never really instances where they completely disagree with fWAR/bWAR but anything more than a slight difference is meaningful to them

**on how the playoffs change how Yankees analytics operates**

In the playoffs, Yankees do granular work about opposing team tendencies. It's not really worth it to do this amount of work during the regular season, but in a 5/7 game series, this potential benefit is far greater. For example, we'll study hours of film and use analytics/computer science to find a pitcher's tell when they do pickoffs. 

**on MLB teams' analytics department**

Yankees and Dodges are on the high end of the spectrum with around 15-20 people. Teams like the Rockies have only 3. *I make a joke about that* The Rockies only have 3 people but all 3 are like geniuses so works for them

**Skills valued at job**

Technical knowledge of the game and the analysis you do. You've probably seen the NFL False start strategy used to waste 3 minutes of the clock recently. We have people who try to look into these loopholes

**What was the atmosphere there when the Astros punishment was announced?**

There was a lot of shadenfreude here. 2017 stuff is clearly real and if they're cheating in 2019, they're doing a shitty job of it. Overall, if you combine the granular work teams do in the playoffs on their opponents with a sophisticated system, their home/away splits in the playoffs make sense (when you compare them to the regular season home/away splits)",self.NYYankees,es2hew,25,False,NYYankees

Which in reality fielding stats are not only very inconsistent but probably had a lot to do with his age. 

For some reason you can‚Äôt bring up the gold gloves when talking about Jeter because some people just assume he gotten because he was Derek Jeter. 

If Players and Managers saw him play everyday and as a collective thought he was a great fielder and passed the eye test... then why doesn‚Äôt he deserve them?! 

We don‚Äôt even have conclusive evidence about how good he was in his prime defensively either other than the Gold Gloves.

Sure in his mid 30‚Äôs to late 30‚Äôs is range was horrible but even then he was always a very sure handed defensive shortstop with a great arm. 

People literally ran with his last 5 years defensive UZR (which I don‚Äôt even trust much) and act like he was an awful fielder his whole career.

Before Fangraphs no one was calling Jeter a bad defensive shortstop... then they started looking at random numbers and all of the sudden he was awful? Is ridiculous, he simply got old and lost his range. 

Nor players or coaches ever thought he was a mediocre fielder and he was being compared to other elite shortstops... so why should we?!

Jeter was a great fielding shortstop that lost his range when he hit his mid 30‚Äôs but still remained a sure handed shortstop with a good arm as he got older, I‚Äôll die on this hill.",self.NYYankees,es19vk,24,False,NYYankees

So talking with friends about what else they could have done and just going through what if‚Äôs and other crazy scenarios I thought of a creative punishment.

Leave the Astros and Red Sox in the American League... but take away their DH. They wanted to steal signs to up their offense? Make them face AL teams that still get to use their DH while their pitchers have to bat. That would effect their offense and batting heavily. We all know pitchers can hit a good one here and there, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an insult to the NL.

The whole time this was happening Cole was pitching a perfect game and the Yankees kept on scoring runs and eventually scored 100 runs which made the entire stadium go crazy and bang their trash can bodies. Eventually the entire Astros team was literally crying and bawling their eyes out in shame as Garrett Cole finally got the 27th out and threw a perfect game.   


For some reason though the Yankees still went out to hit in the bottom of the 9th and Aaron Judge hit a walk off home run despite being up by 100 runs and ran the bases shouting ""BANG BANG BANG!"" as the crowd of Yankee fans in trash can costumes lost their collective shit and started running onto the field chasing after the Astros who ran away in horror.   


The best part of this dream though was the actual walk off celebration. As all the Yankees were running to home plate the camera zoomed into the Brett Gardner grabbing a trash can full of Gatorade and pouring it on Aaron Judge and while this was happening Suzyn was trying to stay something but John told her to shut up and he just started saying the word ""Bang"" with different inflections in his voice until it went back to commercial and then I heard Mike Francesa's theme song and the camera zoomed into him he just said ""Bang from the Bronx you're on the FAN"" and then I got woken up by my mom who said I was tossing and turning in the bed and making weird noises.",self.NYYankees,eqauo1,9,False,NYYankees

In regards to her claims that the Astros were using buzzers, this rumor has been going on since the playoffs. There have been whispers about this from Jomboy and Bauer for months now. This was not something this person magically come up with.

Any worries about our new ace getting caught up in this shit show? It sounds like a large focus of this is on 2017 when Cole was still a Pirate, but some sources think it could have been going on into 2019 as well. 

Being a pitcher you could easily see how he might not have been involved, but you would think he must have known about it, right?

Even more so, I remember being pretty put off by Cole after Houston lost the WS and seemed to so quickly sever ties with the team; at the time, I read that as him being not being a great team guy and maybe not the best clubhouse piece. After his Press Conference, and the fallout this last week, it makes more sense to me that he knew what was going on, hence being so quick to distance himself minutes after becoming a free agent.

Sure we beat the Sox that year in ALC'S in Game 7 (mostly due to Mike Mussina coming in late in the game and saving it for us after Clemens was to blow it all for us) and you could that year's ALCS was the real World Series for us.  But I'll still think the Yankees could have beat the Marlins in the World Series had the MLB postponed the series a few days to give the team the much needed rest they needed before starting the World Series.

Never before in professional American sports has there been a scandal involving such organized efforts by teams to cheat, to the extent that these teams stole two championships. In terms of the severity of the damage to the game, this surpasses the steroid era, because you're actually having teams sponsor cheating, instead of turning a blind eye to it. The only comparable events in baseball history, in terms of the sport's history, are the organized throwing of games in the Black Sox scandal, and Pete Rose betting against the Reds as a player manager. And in those cases, the offending parties got banned for life.  
  
I understand if you don't ban offending players for life here, assuming they were just followers of these systems, but with regards to the ringleaders and the organizations themselves, these people got off WAY too easily for how much damage was done to the sport over the last three years.  
  
I may not be able to go see the Yankees because I don't live near the Stadium, but that's my rationale for hoping people start demanding for Manfred to be fired. He is an utter disgrace, and a coward to the sport of baseball.",self.NYYankees,epk3f4,2,False,NYYankees

1579119361,I didn't know so much about the history of sign stealing until I went to the Houston Rockets sub.,"This was posted as a comment as Houston fans were complaining about the current weeks bad performances by their sports teams.

  


Not only that, there‚Äôs been sign stealing for 120 years. Back then they had a telescope and a button that buzzed outside the dugout, 1 buzz for off speed, 2 for fast, that sorta thing. Base coach signs to hitters. It‚Äôs not new. That‚Äôs why baseball is the most paranoid sport is existence. It‚Äôs literally a part of the game. The pitcher and catcher can switch signs mid game if they have suspicions. I played baseball at a high level for most of my years, that‚Äôs just how it‚Äôs always been. It‚Äôs just media blowing it up because they love to blow this stuff up, like the Patriots scandals, the saints bounty scandal. Those coaches didn‚Äôt get fired they are still there. The saints tried to hurt players and get them out of games. The Patriots videotaped practices and got information on entire formation groupings, plays etc, messed with the game balls themselves. What they are doing to the Astros is absolutely ridiculous. I don‚Äôt SUPPORT cheating but Jesus Christ spread the punishment around the damn league and stop trying to make our city sound like the scum of the earth and be honest with people",self.NYYankees,ep7pjx,7,False,NYYankees

1579118861,The Hypocrisy of Justin Verlander,"The hypocrisy of Justin Verlander.

1) a few years back, a baseball prospect was videoed in a domestic violence incident. Verlander said ‚ÄúI hope the rest of your life without baseball is horrible,‚Äù and added a middle-finger emoji. ‚ÄúYou deserve all that is coming your way.‚Äù

Soon after, Verlander‚Äôs general manager (ex general manager as of monday) brought in a relief pitcher who was under investigation for domestic abuse, Verlander said ‚Äúi have to listen‚Äù and ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know the facts.‚Äù But everyone else knew the facts about Verlander‚Äôs new teammate. Osuna wound up agreeing to a plea deal a couple months later. We should point out that, unless Verlander was present at the incident involving that prospect a few years ago, he didn‚Äôt know the facts about that either. I guess it‚Äôs easier to ‚Äúlisten to everything‚Äù when it‚Äôs your teammate slapping someone around.

2) Verlander calls for players using steroids to be banned and calls out specific players like robbie cano and dee gordon, even proposing that players caught with PEDs be banned for life. When his teammate johnny peralta was caught, Verlander‚Äôs quote was ‚Äúeveryone makes mistakes.‚Äù Hypocrite.

The other thing to note is that Verlander himself is suspicious in my mind. The guy was finished and all of a sudden, at age 36, he‚Äôs superman again. Sounds a lot like Roger Clemens‚Äô career. Fishy. But unproven for now.

3) Verlander constantly talks about the integrity of baseball and wanting a ‚Äúclean game.‚Äù But now we find out that Verlander (the conscience of baseball, apparently) played on a team that was blatantly cheating by using electronic equipment to gain an advantage against other teams. In fact, it was proven that his team cheated the year Verlander won his only world series ring. During those very playoffs.

In response to this, Verlander said..... Nothing! The biggest, most annoying loudmouth in the league, the biggest holier than thou asswipe (forgive my french) in the league has nothing to say about his team cheating. And if you think he didn‚Äôt know it was happening while it was happening, then you‚Äôll need to have your head examined.

Conclusion: Justin Verlander is a Hypocrite and a few other things we won‚Äôt mention here. A true sucker emcee.

Secondly, I see a lot of calls for a asterisk next to there name as champions in 2017.  Why not strip the title from the completely? 

There was a similar instance in Australia where a rugby league team knowingly cheated the salary cap over a 5 year period. During that time they won the championship twice. Part of the punishment handed down was that their championship titles were stripped. It shows in 2007 and 2009 there was no winner. [More info here](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/22/melbourne-storm-salary-cap)

IMO This hurts and stains the Astros reputation more than an asterisk ever could. It also would stand as constant reminder of what they did for generations to come.

1579047555,Realistic Punishment for the Astros,"I think I can safely say that most people on this sub were disappointed with the punishment the MLB gave Houston. Personally, I believe it was way too lenient. $5 million and some draft picks isn't really gonna do much to their franchise. The draft picks might have some affect in like 5 years but honestly they probably wouldn't have been too high of picks anyway. Also, losing Luhnow is definitely going to hurt but his system is already in place. And Hinch is a good manager other than this whole debacle but I don't think it's going to hurt them too much.

Although I would have loved to see them vacate the title and throw in some player suspensions/bans I knew it wasn't going to happen. I was trying to think of more realistic punishments and I think Buck Showalter had the best idea while he was on YES awhile ago. Postseason bans. I'm not exactly sure how it would work but to me this would be the best way to punish the organization and their players, well at least current ones, immediately in a way that carries some weight. 

Even though they had to cheat their way to the WS Houston is still a really good team and will be competitive over the next few years. A ban on participating in the post season would hurt them in the immediate future and greatly affect the players. A team this good would essentially be in limbo for however long it was. Lets say its 2 years. Over the next 2 season they could compete and win their division again but it'll be all for not and have nothing to truly show for it. Tanking wouldn't benefit them either since 1 their draft picks are taken away for the next two years and 2 they have to many talented players for that. Force them to play noncompetitive baseball if they were so okay with cheating.

tldr: MLB should have banned the Astros come participating in the postseason for the next 2 season to punish the organization as a whole and the players.",self.NYYankees,eou8x0,11,False,NYYankees

However, Astros owner Jim Crane avoided being implicated, pays a (relatively) small fine, and has to make some personnel adjustments.  He even looks like a moral authority since he took the suspensions a step further by firing the GM and Manager.

But he has made a mistake.

If we are to believe he fired the GM and Manager because he has zero tolerance for cheating then he has to take the next logical step.  

He has to start firing players.

I understand that MLB could not issue suspensions given that some players involved are on other teams.  Also it is impossible to determine EVERY player involved and thus punishment would be uneven.
Saint Crane, however, is under no such limits.  He does not tolerate cheating and a simple review of the document and game tape could give you a handful of Astros players who participated.
Even suspensions served non-concurrently makes more sense than nothing.  This also makes a postseason appearance far less likely so none of us have to hear Costas harp on about it during the ALDS.

                           MLB COMPLETES ASTROS‚Äô INVESTIGATION
         Major League Baseball announced today that it has completed its investigation into various matters

 regarding the Houston Astros. The decision by Commissioner Robert D. Manfred, Jr. accompanies this press

 release.

                                                   ###
 Contact: Matt Bourne or Michael Teevan, Major League Baseball, (212) 931-7878, mlbpressbox.com,
 @MLB_PR.
                             Statement of the Commissioner

        On November 12, 2019, former Houston Astros player Mike Fiers publicly alleged
in an article published by Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich of The Athletic that the Astros
had engaged in sign-stealing methods in 2017 that violated MLB‚Äôs rules. The allegations
in the article created significant concern among many of our fans and other MLB Clubs
regarding the adherence to our rules by those participating in our games, and the principles
of sportsmanship and fair competition. As I have previously stated, I treat these allegations
with the utmost seriousness, and I instructed our Department of Investigations (‚ÄúDOI‚Äù) to
conduct a thorough investigation. I believe transparency with our fans and our Clubs
regarding what occurred is extremely important, and this report is my attempt to achieve
that objective. At the outset, I also can say our investigation revealed absolutely no
evidence that Jim Crane, the owner of the Astros, was aware of any of the conduct
described in this report. Crane is extraordinarily troubled and upset by the conduct of
members of his organization, fully supported my investigation, and provided unfettered
access to any and all information requested.

        The investigation was led by Bryan Seeley and Moira Weinberg of the DOI, who
both have substantial experience investigating baseball operations matters. The
investigation covered the period from 2016 through the present. During the investigation,
the DOI interviewed 68 witnesses, including 23 current and former Astros players. Some
witnesses were interviewed multiple times. The DOI also reviewed tens of thousands of
emails, Slack communications, text messages, video clips, and photographs. The Astros
fully cooperated with the investigation, producing all requested electronic communications
and making all requested employees available for interviews. Upon request, certain Astros
employees provided their cellular telephones to be imaged and searched. I afforded the
Astros and their employees the opportunity to submit evidence relevant to this matter and
present any arguments to me and my staff.

       I write now to explain the findings of the investigation, and the basis for my
decision to discipline the Astros and certain individuals.

                                     Factual Findings

I.     Rules Violations in the 2017 Season

        At the beginning of the 2017 season, employees in the Astros‚Äô video replay review
room began using the live game feed from the center field camera to attempt to decode and
transmit opposing teams‚Äô sign sequences (i.e., which sign flashed by the catcher is the
actual sign) for use when an Astros runner was on second base. Once the sign sequence
was decoded, a player in the video replay review room would act as a ‚Äúrunner‚Äù to relay the
information to the dugout, and a person in the dugout would notify the players in the dugout
or signal the sign sequence to the runner on second base, who in turn would decipher the
catcher‚Äôs sign and signal to the batter from second base. Early in the season, Alex Cora,
the Astros‚Äô Bench Coach, began to call the replay review room on the replay phone to
obtain the sign information. On at least some occasions, the employees in the replay review
room communicated the sign sequence information by text message, which was received
In re Houston Astros
Decision
Page 2


on the smart watch of a staff member on the bench, or in other cases on a cell phone stored
nearby.

         Approximately two months into the 2017 season, a group of players, including
Carlos Beltr√°n, discussed that the team could improve on decoding opposing teams‚Äô signs
and communicating the signs to the batter. Cora arranged for a video room technician to
install a monitor displaying the center field camera feed immediately outside of the Astros‚Äô
dugout. (The center field camera was primarily used for player development purposes and
was allowed under MLB rules at the time when used for that purpose.) Witnesses have
provided largely consistent accounts of how the monitor was utilized. One or more players
watched the live feed of the center field camera on the monitor, and after decoding the sign,
a player would bang a nearby trash can with a bat to communicate the upcoming pitch type
to the batter. (Witnesses explained that they initially experimented with communicating
sign information by clapping, whistling, or yelling, but that they eventually determined that
banging a trash can was the preferred method of communication.) Players occasionally
also used a massage gun to bang the trash can. Generally, one or two bangs corresponded
to certain off-speed pitches, while no bang corresponded to a fastball.

        Witnesses consistently describe this new scheme as player-driven, and with the
exception of Cora, non-player staff, including individuals in the video replay review room,
had no involvement in the banging scheme. However, witnesses made clear that everyone
proximate to the Astros‚Äô dugout presumptively heard or saw the banging. In addition to
players using the monitor installed near the dugout to decode signs, employees in the
Astros‚Äô replay review room continued to decode sign sequences using the monitors in the
room and communicate those sequences to the dugout for use when a runner was on second
base. Both methods of sign stealing were used by the team in parallel throughout the 2017
season.

       In August 2017, the Boston Red Sox were caught transmitting sign information
from their replay review room to individuals in the dugout wearing smart watches. The
incident received significant media attention, and I issued a press release on September 15,
2017 announcing the fine of the Red Sox (and a fine of the New York Yankees for
improperly using the replay review room phone) that stated in relevant part:

       At the outset, it is important to understand that the attempt to decode signs
       being used by an opposing catcher is not a violation of any Major League
       Baseball Rule or Regulation. Major League Baseball Regulations do,
       however, prohibit the use of electronic equipment during games and state
       that no such equipment ‚Äúmay be used for the purpose of stealing signs or
       conveying information designed to give a Club an advantage.‚Äù Despite this
       clear Regulation, the prevalence of technology, especially the technology
       used in the replay process, has made it increasingly difficult to monitor
       appropriate and inappropriate uses of electronic equipment. Based on the
       investigation by my office, I have nonetheless concluded that during the
In re Houston Astros
Decision
Page 3


       2017 season the Boston Red Sox violated the Regulation quoted above by
       sending electronic communications from their video replay room to an
       athletic trainer in the dugout.

        Following the issuance of the press release announcing the results of the Red Sox
investigation, I issued a memorandum that same day to all Clubs reiterating the rules
regarding the use of electronic equipment to steal signs, and putting all Clubs on notice that
future violations would be taken extremely seriously by my office. I specifically stated in
the memorandum that the General Manager and Field Manager of Clubs would be held
accountable for any violations of the rules in the future. Thus, all Clubs were put on notice
as of September 15, 2017 that any use of electronic equipment to steal signs would be dealt
with more severely by my office.
        Notwithstanding the publicity surrounding the Red Sox incident, and the September
15th memorandum that I sent to all Clubs, the Astros continued to both utilize the replay
review room and the monitor located next to the dugout to decode signs for the remainder
of the regular season and throughout the Postseason.

II.    Rules Violations in Subsequent Seasons

        During the 2017-2018 offseason, and following a discussion at the General
Managers‚Äô Meetings, the Commissioner‚Äôs Office notified Clubs that the phone connecting
the replay review room and the dugout would be monitored to ensure that it was not used
for any purpose other than discussing a challenge of a play on the field. In addition, in
March 2018, Joe Torre issued a memorandum to all Clubs that expanded upon the
prohibition against using electronic equipment to steal signs. The memorandum stated in
relevant part:

       Major League Baseball Regulation 1-1 prohibits all uniformed personnel,
       clubhouse staff and equipment staff from using or possessing telephones or
       similar electronic devices, including any type of walkie-talkies, mobile
       phones, ‚Äòsmart watches‚Äô (e.g., Apple watches), laptop computers, tablets or
       other communication devices, in or near the dugout, in the bullpens or on
       the playing field once batting practice has begun. MLBR 1-1 also prohibits
       the use of such devices in the clubhouse within 30 minutes of the start of a
       game. The prohibition includes the use of any electronic equipment that
       has the capability to receive electronic messages by any person occupying
       the bench or in the bullpen.

                                      *       *       *

       Electronic equipment, including game feeds in the Club replay room and/or
       video room, may never be used during a game for the purpose of stealing
       the opposing team‚Äôs signs. In this respect, MLBR 1-1 expressly provides
       that ‚Äúunder no circumstance may electronic equipment or devices be used
In re Houston Astros
Decision
Page 4


       for the purpose of stealing signs or conveying other information designed
       to give a Club a competitive advantage.‚Äù To be clear, the use of any
       equipment in the clubhouse or in a Club‚Äôs replay or video rooms to
       decode an opposing Club‚Äôs signs during the game violates this
       Regulation. (Emphasis in original.) Clubs (and Club employees) who are
       found to have utilized equipment in the replay or video rooms for such
       purposes during a game will be subject to discipline by the Commissioner‚Äôs
       Office.

        Prior to the 2018 season, and with MLB approval, the Astros relocated their replay
review system to a video room located much closer to the dugout, as is the case in many
ballparks throughout the league. The investigation uncovered no evidence that Astros
players utilized the banging scheme in 2018. However, the Astros‚Äô replay review room
staff continued, at least for part of the 2018 season, to decode signs using the live center
field camera feed, and to transmit the signs to the dugout through in-person
communication. At some point during the 2018 season, the Astros stopped using the replay
review room to decode signs because the players no longer believed it was effective. The
investigation did not reveal any attempt by the Astros to utilize electronic equipment to
decode and transmit signs in the 2018 Postseason.

        Prior to the 2019 season, the Commissioner‚Äôs Office issued a revised policy
governing sign stealing, which, among other things, included the placement of individuals
retained by the Commissioner‚Äôs Office in the Club‚Äôs replay review rooms to ensure that no
rules violations occurred (a practice that began in the 2018 Postseason). The investigation
revealed no violations of the policy by the Astros in the 2019 season or 2019 Postseason.

      Other than described above, the investigation did not reveal any other scheme or
method utilized by the Astros to decode an opposing Club‚Äôs signs from 2016 to the present.

III.   Culpability of Astros Players and Employees for Rules Violations

        The Astros‚Äô methods in 2017 and 2018 to decode and communicate to the batter an
opposing Club‚Äôs signs were not an initiative that was planned or directed by the Club‚Äôs top
baseball operations officials. Rather, the 2017 scheme in which players banged on a trash
can was, with the exception of Cora, player-driven and player-executed. The attempt by
the Astros‚Äô replay review room staff to decode signs using the center field camera was
originated and executed by lower-level baseball operations employees working in
conjunction with Astros players and Cora. The efforts involving the replay review room
staff were mentioned in at least two emails sent to Luhnow, and there is conflicting
evidence about conversations with Luhnow on the topic. Regardless of the level of
Luhnow‚Äôs actual knowledge, the Astros‚Äô violation of rules in 2017 and 2018 is attributable,
in my view, to a failure by the leaders of the baseball operations department and the Field
Manager to adequately manage the employees under their supervision, to establish a culture
In re Houston Astros
Decision
Page 5


in which adherence to the rules is ingrained in the fabric of the organization, and to stop
bad behavior as soon as it occurred.

The Astros Players. Most of the position players on the 2017 team either received sign
information from the banging scheme or participated in the scheme by helping to decode
signs or bang on the trash can. Many of the players who were interviewed admitted that
they knew the scheme was wrong because it crossed the line from what the player believed
was fair competition and/or violated MLB rules. Players stated that if Manager A.J. Hinch
told them to stop engaging in the conduct, they would have immediately stopped.

        Although the Astros‚Äô players did not attempt to hide what they were doing from
Hinch or other Astros employees, they were concerned about getting caught by players
from other teams. Several players told my investigators that there was a sense of ‚Äúpanic‚Äù
in the Astros‚Äô dugout after White Sox pitcher Danny Farquhar appeared to notice the trash
can bangs. Before the game ended, a group of Astros players removed the monitor from
the wall in the tunnel and hid it in an office. For the Postseason, a portable monitor was
set up on a table to replace the monitor that had been affixed to the wall near the dugout.

        Some Astros players told my investigators that they did not believe the sign-stealing
scheme was effective, and it was more distracting than useful to hitters. I am neither in a
position to evaluate whether the scheme helped Astros hitters (who were unquestionably a
very talented group), nor whether it helped the Astros win any games. There are so many
factors that impact the outcome of games that addressing that issue would require rank
speculation. But for purposes of my decision, regardless of whether the scheme was
effective or not, it violated the rules and, at a minimum, created the appearance of
unfairness, and for that, it necessitates severe discipline.

        I will not assess discipline against individual Astros players. I made the decision
in September 2017 that I would hold a Club‚Äôs General Manager and Field Manager
accountable for misconduct of this kind, and I will not depart from that decision. Assessing
discipline of players for this type of conduct is both difficult and impractical. It is difficult
because virtually all of the Astros‚Äô players had some involvement or knowledge of the
scheme, and I am not in a position based on the investigative record to determine with any
degree of certainty every player who should be held accountable, or their relative degree
of culpability. It is impractical given the large number of players involved, and the fact
that many of those players now play for other Clubs.

        But more importantly, the Club‚Äôs General Manager and Field Manager are
responsible for ensuring that the players both understand the rules and adhere to them. Our
office issues a substantial number of detailed rules and procedures to Clubs ‚Äì many of
which, including the sign stealing rules, are not sent directly to players. It is the obligation
of the Club, and, in this case, the General Manager and Field Manager, to educate and
instruct their players on the rules governing play on the field. Here, because the Club‚Äôs
Bench Coach was an active participant in the scheme, and the Club‚Äôs Manager was aware
In re Houston Astros
Decision
Page 6


of the scheme and did nothing to stop it, I recognize that some players may have understood
that their conduct was not only condoned by the Club, but encouraged by it. This was
misconduct committed by the team, and with the exception of the individuals whom I will
hold personally accountable, my disciplinary action will be directed at the team.

Jeff Luhnow (General Manager). Luhnow adamantly denies knowledge of both the
banging scheme and the efforts by the replay review room staff to decode signs and
transmit them to the dugout. The investigation revealed no evidence to suggest that
Luhnow was aware of the banging scheme. The investigation also revealed that Luhnow
neither devised nor actively directed the efforts of the replay review room staff to decode
signs in 2017 or 2018. Although Luhnow denies having any awareness that his replay
review room staff was decoding and transmitting signs, there is both documentary and
testimonial evidence that indicates Luhnow had some knowledge of those efforts, but he
did not give it much attention.

        Irrespective of Luhnow‚Äôs knowledge of his Club‚Äôs violations of the rules, I will
hold him personally accountable for the conduct of his Club. It is the job of the General
Manager to be aware of the activities of his staff and players, and to ensure that those
activities comport with both standards of conduct set by Club ownership and MLB rules.
Despite his knowledge of the Red Sox incident in September 2017, and receipt of both my
September 15, 2017 memorandum and Joe Torre‚Äôs March 2018 memorandum, Luhnow
failed to take any adequate steps to ensure that his Club was in compliance with the rules.
Luhnow did not forward the memoranda and did not confirm that the players and field staff
were in compliance with MLB rules and the memoranda. Had Luhnow taken those steps
in September 2017, it is clear to me that the Astros would have ceased both sign-stealing
schemes at that time.

        Finally, I will make some general observations regarding the Astros‚Äô baseball
operations department that were gleaned from the 68 interviews my investigators
conducted in addition to the nine interviews conducted regarding a separate investigation
into former Assistant General Manager Brandon Taubman‚Äôs conduct during a clubhouse
celebration. Like many Clubs with very experienced individuals running their baseball
operations departments, Astros owner Jim Crane and his senior executive team spent their
energies focused on running the business side of the Club while delegating control and
discretion on the baseball side to Luhnow. And it is difficult to question that division of
responsibilities in light of the fact that Luhnow is widely considered to be one of the most
successful baseball executives of his generation, credited with ushering in the second
‚Äúanalytics‚Äù revolution in baseball and rebuilding the Houston Astros into a perennial
Postseason contender. But while no one can dispute that Luhnow‚Äôs baseball operations
department is an industry leader in its analytics, it is very clear to me that the culture of the
baseball operations department, manifesting itself in the way its employees are treated, its
relations with other Clubs, and its relations with the media and external stakeholders, has
been very problematic. At least in my view, the baseball operations department‚Äôs insular
culture ‚Äì one that valued and rewarded results over other considerations, combined with a
In re Houston Astros
Decision
Page 7


staff of individuals who often lacked direction or sufficient oversight, led, at least in part,
to the Brandon Taubman incident, the Club‚Äôs admittedly inappropriate and inaccurate
response to that incident, and finally, to an environment that allowed the conduct described
in this report to have occurred. The comments in this paragraph relate only to the baseball
operations department. This aspect of our investigation did not extend to the business side
of the Club that functioned independently of baseball operations.

A.J. Hinch (Field Manager). Hinch neither devised the banging scheme nor participated
in it. Hinch told my investigators that he did not support his players decoding signs using
the monitor installed near the dugout and banging the trash can, and he believed that the
conduct was both wrong and distracting. Hinch attempted to signal his disapproval of the
scheme by physically damaging the monitor on two occasions, necessitating its
replacement. However, Hinch admits he did not stop it and he did not notify players or
Cora that he disapproved of it, even after the Red Sox were disciplined in September 2017.
Similarly, he knew of and did not stop the communication of sign information from the
replay review room, although he disagreed with this practice as well and specifically voiced
his concerns on at least one occasion about the use of the replay phone for this purpose.
As the person with responsibility for managing his players and coaches, there simply is no
justification for Hinch‚Äôs failure to act. If Hinch was unsure about how to handle the
situation, it was his responsibility to bring the issue to the attention of Luhnow. Hinch
expressed much contrition both to me and my investigators for allowing the conduct to
continue. Although I appreciate Hinch‚Äôs remorsefulness, I must hold him accountable for
the conduct of his team, particularly since he had full knowledge of the conduct and chose
to allow it to continue throughout the 2017 Postseason.

Alex Cora (Bench Coach). Cora was involved in developing both the banging scheme
and utilizing the replay review room to decode and transmit signs. Cora participated in
both schemes, and through his active participation, implicitly condoned the players‚Äô
conduct. I will withhold determining the appropriate level of discipline for Cora until after
the DOI completes its investigation of the allegations that the Red Sox engaged in
impermissible electronic sign stealing in 2018 while Cora was the manager.

Brandon Taubman (former Assistant General Manager). Taubman‚Äôs employment was
terminated by the Astros on October 24, 2019 for his inappropriate conduct toward one or
more female reporters at the American League Championship Series post-game
celebration. On November 15, 2019, I told Taubman that he would be placed on the
ineligible list for that conduct pending completion of this sign-stealing investigation. My
investigators interviewed Taubman regarding the sign-stealing allegations, and like
Luhnow, Taubman denied knowledge of both the banging scheme and the use of the replay
review room to transmit signs. I find it unnecessary to determine Taubman‚Äôs culpability
for the Astros‚Äô rules violations because, as described below, I am imposing significant
discipline on him for his inappropriate conduct in the clubhouse.
In re Houston Astros
Decision
Page 8


Astros Owner and Chairman Jim Crane. Jim Crane was unaware of any of the
violations of MLB rules by his Club. In fact, Crane told Luhnow after the Red Sox
discipline was announced that Luhnow should make sure that the Astros did not engage in
similar conduct.

        Some lower-level Astros employees were aware of the rules violations or
participated in the violations at the direction of others. I will defer to the Astros whether
the conduct of these more junior employees merits discipline or other remedial action.

                                         Discipline

        I find that the conduct of the Astros, and its senior baseball operations executives,
merits significant discipline. I base this finding on the fact that the Club‚Äôs senior baseball
operations executives were given express notice in September 2017 that I would hold them
accountable for violations of our policies covering sign stealing, and those individuals took
no action to ensure that the Club‚Äôs players and staff complied with those policies during
the 2017 Postseason and the 2018 regular season. The conduct described herein has caused
fans, players, executives at other MLB Clubs, and members of the media to raise questions
about the integrity of games in which the Astros participated. And while it is impossible
to determine whether the conduct actually impacted the results on the field, the perception
of some that it did causes significant harm to the game.

Astros Team Discipline

   1. The Club will forfeit its regular first and second round selections in the 2020 and
      2021 First-Year Player Drafts. To the extent that the Club does not have a regular
      first or second round selection in either of those years by operation of the Basic
      Agreement or Major League Rules, the Club shall forfeit the applicable selection
      in the next First-Year Player Draft in which it possesses such selection. For the
      purpose of clarity, the Club will forfeit two regular first round selections and two
      regular second round selections in total. The forfeited draft selections will be
      removed from the selection order and all other selections will move up.

   2. The Club will pay to my office a fine of $5 million, which is the highest allowable
      fine under the Major League Constitution.

Individual Discipline

   1. Jeff Luhnow shall be suspended without pay for the period beginning on January
      13, 2020 and ending on the day following the completion of the 2020 World Series.
      During the period of his suspension, Luhnow is prohibited from performing any
      services for or conducting any business on behalf of the Astros or any other Major
      League Club. Luhnow must not be present in any Major League, Minor League,
      or Spring Training facilities, including stadiums, and he may not travel with or on
In re Houston Astros
Decision
Page 9


       behalf of the Club. During the period of his suspension, my office will discuss with
       Luhnow an appropriate program of management/leadership training to ensure that
       no incidents of the type described in this report occur in the future. If Luhnow is
       found to engage in any future material violations of the Major League Rules, he
       will be placed on the permanently ineligible list.

   2. A.J. Hinch shall be suspended without pay for the period beginning on January 13,
      2020 and ending on the day following the completion of the 2020 World Series.
      During the period of his suspension, Hinch is prohibited from performing any
      services for or conducting any business on behalf of the Astros or any other Major
      League Club. Hinch must not be present in any Major League, Minor League, or
      Spring Training facilities, including stadiums, and he may not travel with or on
      behalf of the Club. If Hinch is found to engage in any future material violations of
      the Major League Rules, he will be placed on the permanently ineligible list.

   3. Based on his inappropriate conduct in the clubhouse on October 19, 2019, Brandon
      Taubman shall be ineligible to perform services on behalf of any Major League
      Club, either as an employee or independent contractor, through the day following
      the completion of the 2020 World Series, at which time he will be eligible to apply
      to me for reinstatement. If Taubman is found to engage in any future material
      violations of the Major League Rules, he will be placed on the permanently
      ineligible list.

He was 11 runs below average.  Voit was also pretty bad at 1B this year, at 6 runs below average.  Also not surprising:  LeMahieu was good at every position he played.  He was our best defensive infielder last year.

Now here's the biggest surprise to me:  Didi was actually really bad at SS according to Statcast.  He was -3 runs in 2017, which is below average, but it's pretty close to just average.  In 2018, that dropped to -7 runs.  Then, in just half a season in 2019, he was a whopping 13 runs below average.  To put that in perspective, that's a rate almost twice as worse as Andujar's 2018 at 3B...  I really wonder if the Yankees had some kind of similar internal metric that showed them that Didi was regressing pretty hard defensively, and that's why they were ok with letting him walk.

Some other interesting notes:  Urshela was just average at 3B.  Torres was pretty decent at SS.  He was a little below average at -3 runs, but certainly good enough to play there.  Mike Ford was actually above average at 1B.",self.NYYankees,eoic4b,15,False,NYYankees

1578945992,Players Culpability,"From Manfred's statement:

&gt; The Astros Players. Most of the position players on the 2017 team either received sign information from the banging scheme or participated in the scheme by helping to decode signs or bang on the trash can. Many of the players who were interviewed admitted that they knew the scheme was wrong because it crossed the line from what the player believed was fair competition and/or violated MLB rules. Players stated that if Manager A.J. Hinch told them to stop engaging in the conduct, they would have immediately stopped.   
&gt;  
&gt;Although the Astros‚Äô players did not attempt to hide what they were doing from Hinch or other Astros employees, they were concerned about getting caught by players from other teams. Several players told my investigators that there was a sense of ‚Äúpanic‚Äù in the Astros‚Äô dugout after White Sox pitcher Danny Farquhar appeared to notice the trash can bangs. Before the game ended, a group of Astros players removed the monitor from the wall in the tunnel and hid it in an office. For the Postseason, a portable monitor was set up on a table to replace the monitor that had been affixed to the wall near the dugout.  
&gt;  
&gt; Some Astros players told my investigators that they did not believe the sign-stealing scheme was effective, and it was more distracting than useful to hitters. I am neither in a position to evaluate whether the scheme helped Astros hitters (who were unquestionably a very talented group), nor whether it helped the Astros win any games. There are so many factors that impact the outcome of games that addressing that issue would require rank speculation. But for purposes of my decision, regardless of whether the scheme was effective or not, it violated the rules and, at a minimum, created the appearance of unfairness, and for that, it necessitates severe discipline.   
&gt;  
&gt;I will not assess discipline against individual Astros players. I made the decision in September 2017 that I would hold a Club‚Äôs General Manager and Field Manager accountable for misconduct of this kind, and I will not depart from that decision. Assessing discipline of players for this type of conduct is both difficult and impractical. It is difficult because virtually all of the Astros‚Äô players had some involvement or knowledge of the scheme, and I am not in a position based on the investigative record to determine with any degree of certainty every player who should be held accountable, or their relative degree of culpability. It is impractical given the large number of players involved, and the fact that many of those players now play for other Clubs.   
&gt;  
&gt;But more importantly, the Club‚Äôs General Manager and Field Manager are responsible for ensuring that the players both understand the rules and adhere to them. Our office issues a substantial number of detailed rules and procedures to Clubs ‚Äì many of which, including the sign stealing rules, are not sent directly to players. It is the obligation of the Club, and, in this case, the General Manager and Field Manager, to educate and instruct their players on the rules governing play on the field. Here, because the Club‚Äôs Bench Coach was an active participant in the scheme, and the Club‚Äôs Manager was aware  In re Houston Astros Decision Page 6 of the scheme and did nothing to stop it, I recognize that some players may have understood that their conduct was not only condoned by the Club, but encouraged by it. This was misconduct committed by the team, and with the exception of the individuals whom I will hold personally accountable, my disciplinary action will be directed at the team.  

The parts I specifically take issue with here are in the second to last paragraph. Firstly, this:

&gt;I will not assess discipline against individual Astros players.

Which, alright, given that he said back in September of 2017 that he'd punish the manager and GM, I can wrap my head around it, but then he comes out with this:

&gt;Assessing discipline of players for this type of conduct is both difficult and impractical. It is difficult because virtually all of the Astros‚Äô players had some involvement or knowledge of the scheme, ...  
&gt;  
&gt;It is impractical given the large number of players involved, and the fact that many of those players now play for other Clubs.

Impractical given the large number of players involved? That just sounds like the Astros should've suffered a bigger punishment, since most all of their hitters were cheating. impractical to suss out the responsibility of each player in this scheme sounds like an abdication of the commissioners responsibility to the other 29 clubs, and all 30 clubs fans. Lest we forget that 8 players were banned for life because of the cheating that occurred in 1919. We always knew the money fine couldn't go past $5 mil, draft picks were going to be taken away (but are generally a crap shoot anyway) and AJ Hinch and Ludlow were going to get banned for at least a year. The only way this was going to *sting* was if you either take away the 2017 WS trophy, or if you suspend the players. The only two things that would ever actually deter teams from doing this in the future are the only two things Manfred didn't have the guts to actually do. Anyone else really upset that he didn't effectively punish this team?",self.NYYankees,eo9g1u,5,False,NYYankees

1578870215,My Experience with Zack Hample at Yankee Stadium," 

Earlier this summer, my family and I went to attend The Yankees vs Red Sox game at Yankee Stadium, which is my home ballpark. My sons and I like to go early in hopes of catching balls during batting practice. It was a tradition we liked partaking in, and we enjoyed going and hopefully catching balls.

We got there right when the gates opened, and we headed to the outfield right away. Somehow, by chance, we saw that Zack Hample was here. My kids watch his YouTube channel and I have heard of him, so they went up to him to say hi. For some reason, being the pompous douchebag he was, he completley ignored my kids so he could go chase after a ball. We were kind of annoyed, but we wanted to get a ball, so my kids went up against the fence asking players for a ball.

Zack wiggled his way between my kids, and begged the players for a ball. I was shocked, as he was the only adult in like a group of 30 something kids. One of the players threw a ball to one of the kids, and Hample reached his arm out in front of a kid and got the ball. He then showed his cameraman his ""prize"". The kid was visibly upset, and his father went up to him and asked him what his problem was. Hample told him that it was fair game, and when the cameras were rolling, he gave the kid a ball.

One of the players hit a HR during batting practice, and the ball was coming straight for where my kids were at. My youngest son was about to get the ball, but then Hample bumped into him, knocking my son over, and catching the ball. My son got a scrape from falling and he was bleeding, and Hample just walked away. I chased him down and yelled at him for being such a nuisance, and once again when the cameras were on, he gave the ball to a different kid.

I reported him to security, but nothing ended up happening so we just went back to our seats and tried to enjoy the rest of the game. Luckily, when we went down by the Yankees bullpen, Domingo German threw my son a ball, and that saved the day for us. German really is a stand up guy. 

Overall, we had a good day at Yankee Stadium, but Zack Hample probably shouldn't be allowed to ballhawk anymore, as he constantly causes problems at the park and creates a disturbance. He was a complete douchebag to my kids, and if I ever see him again, I will make sure that he doesn't get a ball.",self.NYYankees,env4v8,12,False,NYYankees

1578636729,Stupid Post (Don't Say That I Didn't Warn You),"I want Arenado on this team. I don't care how much he costs, but I understand price is something that the Yankees have to keep in mind, however, I think a deal with a clause like the Stanton deal, where the Yankees get extra salary relief if Arenado doesn't opt-out could make a deal seriously more sensible to happen.

Rockies Get | Yankees Get
---|---
Clint Frazier - Cheap, Controlled, Solid OF | Nolan Arenado
Gio Ursula - Cheap, Controlled, Solid 3B | $15 Million in 2020
Domingo German - Cheap, Controlled, Solid SP | $10M in 2021-24 wehn . renado doesn't opt-out
Clark Schmitt - SP Prospect, Cheap, Controlled | 
2 Lower, Lottery Prospect Pitchers |

---

Why this Makes Sense:

1. The Rockies are cheep. While they might be giving the Yankees a total of $55 Million over 5 years if Arenado didn't opt out, they would be getting far above that value in what Frazier, Ursula, and German could probably provide before they all reach arbitration, plus it fills up three MLB positions tehy could use a paluer at (LF, 3B, SP) on very cheap deals for players whoos market value is at least $7..5 Million each per year. Each year they'd be winning out over the money they'd be sending back, as they'd only need two of the 3 MLB talents to be solid.

2. The Rockies always need controllabel pitchers becuase Coor's is a craphole, and the porspects the Ysnkees woudl sned would be conrollale and they aee all goint o be rgret pithers beause of Mattthew Blake.

2. The Yankees become a POWERUNIT and don't need the MLB players. They have no room for Frazier (Judge, Stanton, Tauchman, Hicks, Gardy), would have no room for Urshela (Arenado, Andujar), German (Cole, Tanaka, Pax, Sev, Monty, Happ). Think about how much Arenado would boost the offense and defense on this team.

3. Yankees need to make room on the 40-Man for Gardy. This adds 3 spaces for Arenado, Gardy, and another player.

Think of this line-up:

1. DJ Leamahieu, 2B

2. Aaaron Judge, OF

3. Nolan Arenado, 3B

4. Giencarlo Stanton, OF

5. Gleybor Torres, SS

6. Gary Sanchez, C

7. Luke Volt, 1B

8. Michael Andujar, DH

9. Brett Gardenar, OF

Did you know that...

* Frisbees have their origins in northern Europe. Frisbees have been found in the remains of Viking settlements.
* Frisbees seem to be unrelated to the sport of Discus. Discus was developed in ancient Greece, seemingly independently of frisbee, which uses a light disk instead of discus' heavy one.
* In medival Germany, it was considered polite to offer your host a game of frisbee after a meal if you enjoyed it. This is so ingrained in German culture that the word for ""delicious"" is luftscheibe, literally translating to ""air disc"".
* Before Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated using a handgun, there was an attempt on his life using a sharpened frisbee. This is the only known use of a frisbee as a weapon.
* Similar to the famous ""Christmas truce"" during the First World War where opposing soldiers played soccer, in World War II Russian and German soldier played a game of frisbee on Easter, 1942.
* Before businessman John Andrews patented the toy and gave it the name we know today, frisbees were known simply as ""the disc"" or ""flying disc"" and usually were flat and had a large hole in the middle. Andrews filled in the disc and gave it a new shape allowing it to get more lift and fly longer. He also was the first to use plastic instead of wood to construct a frisbee.
* Andrews' family says ""frisbee"" is a word made up by John's daughter and has no real meaning.
